       "      <td>Fintech darling and former Startups 100 winner Revolut has signed a 10-year lease with the YY London building in Canary Wharf. Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards.The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100.The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024.“More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment.Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40%.Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office.However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events.Recruit to the office?Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8,000 staff members in January, to 11,500 by the end of the year.Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants,  a cafe, and outdoor terrace space.Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members.Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London.Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”.Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home.Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate. Rather than penalise staff for working from home, the investment in the YY London building suggests the brand thinks rewards, incentives and a new environment will improve office attendance.It remains to be seen if Revolut’s planned events and workshops will prove exciting enough to keep hybrid teams returning to the office, and encourage new team members to join them.Interested in working at Revolut?

       "top      Fintech darling and former Startups 100 winner Revolut has signed a 10-year lease with the YY London building in Canary Wharf. Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards.The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100.The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024.“More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment.Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40%.Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office.However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events.Recruit to the office?Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8,000 staff members in January, to 11,500 by the end of the year.Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants,  a cafe, and outdoor terrace space.Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members.Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London.Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”.Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home.Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate.

       "      <td>Fintech darling and former Startups 100 winner Revolut has signed a 10-year lease with the YY London building in Canary Wharf. Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards. The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100. The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024. “More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment. Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40% . Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office. However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events. Recruit to the office? Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8, 000 staff members in January, to 11, 500 by the end of the year. Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants, a cafe, and outdoor terrace space. Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members. Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London. Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”. Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home. Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate. Rather than penalise staff for working from home, the investment in the YY London building suggests the brand thinks rewards, incentives and a new environment will improve office attendance. It remains to be seen if Revolut’s planned events and workshops will prove exciting enough to keep hybrid teams returning to the office, and encourage new team members to join them.

       "      <td>Choosing a business name requires a bit of creative thinking. But new data suggests that the upper limits of creativity are being curbed by the government, as profanity-loving business owners come up against the censorship of Companies House. In total, 766 business names were rejected in 2023, with swearing being the main offence. According to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by 1st Formations, curse words made up 24% of business name applications rejected by Companies House last year. Companies House has strict rules about what is and is not allowed in a firm’s title. But experts are now cautioning that the government’s laws on registering a trademark or name might be behind the times with Brits’ love of a good swear word. ‘Doofus’ too rude to be registered as a company nameEntrepreneurs might be curious about just how profanity-laden their business name idea needs to be for Companies House to turn it down. As the 1st Formations findings suggest, even a mildly offensive term might be enough to earn entrepreneurs a rejection letter. Blasphemous business names rejected by Companies House in 2023 include:Little Pricks Tattoo StudioWtf Where’s The FoodPhat Phuc Noodle Bar LtdSee You Next Tuesday LtdForkin Recruitment LtdFukin Takeaway LtdFukim LtdFart LimitedCfuk LimitedInsults that wouldn’t be out of place on a primary school playground can be turned down by Companies House. Just ask the owner of ‘Doofus Dream Cars Limited’ and ‘Lmao Ltd’, both of which were rejected as expletives. Of the 188 business names rejected for swearing, ‘crap’ was also a common occurrence within the list, with names like ‘Crappy Nappy’ and ‘Scrap Your Crap Ltd’ both turned down. This is despite the eco-friendly toilet paper brand, ‘Who Gives A Crap? ’, which is based in Australia, announcing it achieved record UK sales this week, suggesting that Aussie attitudes to swearing are more relaxed than the British government. Companies House needs bringing “up to date”Earlier this year, data compiled by US recommendation service Enjoy Movies Your Way found that the annual number of swear words across mainstream TV shows and films in Western media has surged from fewer than 5, 000 in 1985, to over 60, 000 last year. Linguists today argue that swear words are becoming more acceptable in the UK, and are today used merely to emphasise points rather than cause offence. This language transformation could be why Companies House’s strict policies on supposedly rude names now feel out of touch with modern society. 1st Formations’ Director, Nicholas Campion, argues the list shows the government has an “outdated assessment process. ”“Companies House [may] need to bring itself up to date with modern language usage, as the Oxford English Dictionary has done, and, while we’re at it, accommodate the Great British sense of humour, ” he adds. There could be a real business incentive to adopting a punny business name. Last year, a consumer survey by BusinessNameGenerator showed that 64% of Brits would be more likely to notice and remember a funny company name, which could lead to a boost in sales. How to choose a business nameProfanity was not the only reason for business names being rejected in 2023. The 1st Formations data sorts the list into six prohibited categories:Profanity – 24% Drug references – 16% Sexual content – 15% Violence – 11% Discrimination – 8% Uncategorised – 26% Here are some examples of the kind of organisation names that are forbidden by Companies House for the above reasons:Rejected business nameReason for rejectionHorny Brew LtdSexual contentThe Prince Albert LtdSexual contentJerk Off Chicken LimitedSexual contentDank Productions LtdDrug referencesColin Bakes Dope (Responsibly) Ltd’Drug referencesW H Spliff LtdDrug referencesRagnarok Knives LtdViolencePsycho Traders LtdViolenceKiller Instinct LtdViolenceAryan Boss LtdDiscriminationKKK Properties LtdDiscriminationThere are also a number of other reasons why a company name may be rejected by Companies House, such as excluding “Limited”, “Ltd”, “Cyfyngedig”, “Cyf” or if the name lacks uniqueness or is too similar to another company. For example, W H Spliff would likely be considered objectionable even without the drugs reference, thanks to its similarity to the name of a certain, well-known UK retail chain. Campion advises that “if your proposed company name is similar or identical to a name already registered, Companies House will likely reject the application. ”Registering a company name is a fundamental step when setting up a new firm.

       "      <td>The Labour Party has said it will require all large businesses to publish an Ethnicity Pay Gap report, if it wins the UK general election on July 4. Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer unveiled the new pledges as part of the Labour Party’s official manifesto, titled Change, in Greater Manchester earlier today. Similar to gender pay gap reporting, the legislation would make it mandatory for firms to report on the pay disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff in a workforce. Racial Inequality ActThe principle that all workers, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or disability, are entitled to equal pay for equal work was first set out in the Equal Pay Act. However, the existing legislation does not currently require businesses to divulge the difference in pay for ethnicity. That could soon change if the Labour Party, which is currently winning in UK polls, comes into power. In his speech, Starmer confirmed plans to introduce a new Racial Inequality Act. According to Labour’s manifesto, this would “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people. ”Similar to the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information), the new laws would require some firms to publish specific ethnicity payroll data to reveal any wage disparities. Exact details on how the reporting process would work have not yet been revealed. Based on the current rules for gender pay gap reporting, only organisations with more than 250 employees (classed as large businesses in the UK) would need to publish the data. When comparing average hourly pay for minority ethnic versus white employees, data from the Office for National Statistics shows a mean pay gap of 25. 8% . Disability pay gapAs well as asking large businesses to report on the difference in pay between ethnic minority employees, Labour has also vowed to support more disabled employees in the UK, by requiring companies to publish data on the Disability Pay Gap. Disabled employees are often unable to work full-time, or are forced to go on long-term sickness absence, due to their disability, resulting in lower average wages overall. They also might face barriers and discrimination in employment. In November 2023, TUC analysis of data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that the difference in average earnings between disabled and non-disabled workers is now 14. 6% . This is 5. 5% greater than the gender pay gap between men and women. Starmer also said the party would seek to make disability hate crime an “aggravated offence” and “tackle the Access to Work backlog”. DWP figures show that the number of disabled people waiting for a decision on their Access to Work claim reached 25, 063 by December 2023. Awareness grows of UK pay inequalityLabour has not signalled if it would extend the pledge to cover sexual orientation. On average, LGBTQ+ workers in the UK earn £6, 700 less than their straight counterparts, contributing to a LGBTQ+ Pay Gap. Similarly, it has given no word on the Class Pay Gap, which refers to the difference in pay among workers from different social backgrounds, and few UK employers report on. Still, the decision to introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap data has been welcomed by experts. Melissa Blissett, Pay Gap Analytics Lead at Barnett Waddingham, said it sent “a clear message of fair pay, fair progression, and reward for the workplace. ”However, Blissett also cautioned that “lessons also need to be learnt from gender pay gap reporting”, opining that “reporting itself is not enough to change the dial. ”“Going beyond the reporting figures and analysing the underlying data to monitor trends, progress, potential blockers and drivers of the pay gap will be important, ” she added.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Digital Nomad visas have taken the world by storm. Well, most of it. While 50 countries now have visa programmes specifically for tech and freelance workers, others lag behind. Dreamy destinations such as Japan, Italy, and Thailand have all rolled out their own Digital Nomad-specific schemes this year. Their governments are catching onto the benefits that nomadic workers bring, such as a boost to tourism and the creation of knowledge clusters. But remote workers are still waiting for big-names such as the United States and Australia, and ten countries in the EU, to announce their own schemes. Below, we’ve listed the most sought-after remote work countries that don’t yet offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the alternative work permits that nomadic employees can apply for. 1. UKDespite considerable demand from Brits to work abroad, the UK still doesn’t have its own Digital Nomad visa. We’re also unlikely to announce it anytime soon. Our visa process is highly complex, and the government faces mounting pressure to curb migration numbers. In December, Whitehall raised the minimum income requirement for a skilled overseas worker to £38, 000, making it much more difficult for companies to hire foreign talent. The rules are not much better for short-term stays. As of December 2023, visitors to the UK can now engage in remote work tasks (such as answering emails or taking business calls) on their travel visas, but it cannot be the primary reason for their visit. Read about eight countries that are beating the UK in the race for global tech talent. 2. AustriaLocated on the Eastern Alps, Austria would be a dream deskspace for ski lovers. There’s no Digital Nomad visa available in the country yet. However, there are a number of visa schemes that interested workers and business owners can apply for. They include the Red-White-Red Card for those wanting to launch a business in Austria, and the Schengen Visa, a joined-up scheme that allows you to stay and work in up to 27 EU countries. You’ll be able to spend up to 90 days in each country for a total of 180 days. 3. BelgiumIt gave the world french fries, but teams will need to wait for an official Belgian Digital Nomad visa. It is currently illegal to work in the country as a tourist, and no word has been given yet as to when, and if, a remote working visa is on the cards for the Belgium government. Thankfully, there are still ways you can work in the country of chocolate, waffles, and beer if you’re a sole trader. The Belgium Professional Card, also known as the Freelance Visa or D-Visa, allows freelancers to pursue self-employed work while visiting Belgium. 4. DenmarkDenmark came out on top in the 2023 Global Remote Work Index by network provider Nordlayer. Judges praised the country for its low crime rate and digital infrastructure. But what they didn’t mention is that Denmark doesn’t actually have a Digital Nomad visa. Instead, as with Austria, tech-enabled employees and freelancers who want to live and work in Denmark can apply for a 90-day Schengen Visa to access the land of Lego. Working in Denmark without a work permit is illegal, so this programme is your safest route. 5. FranceFrance received the most visa requests in the last decade, and it is consistently voted as one of the favourite destinations for visa applicants. But the country still does not offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the government has also made no provisions for one. Francophiles can instead apply for the visa de long séjour (“long-stay visa”) to work in the country. It is valid for a period of three months to one year. According to the French government, around 130, 000 Brits applied for the scheme in 2023. 6. NetherlandsThe Netherlands is a lot more than its postcard image suggests. As well as windmills and tulip fields, the country is also a hub of action for remote workers, many of whom flock to the country for the Netherlands Startup Visa, which is a great alternative for digital nomads. Similar to Austria’s Red-White-Red card, the scheme allows foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a one-year temporary residence permit, during which they can launch an “innovative” product or service from their new, Dutch base. 7. AustraliaYou’ll likely already know an expat who had made the great move down under. Thousands of Brits are being drawn to Australia’s warm climate, trendy cities, and beachside lifestyle. As of now, Aussies do not offer an official Digital Nomad visa for remote employees. One outback-route into the country, though, is the Visitor Visa. This is for tourists who would like to live and work in Australia, but don’t sing to the sound of six months of farm work. This visa can be valid for up to one year, and costs an estimated £99 to apply for. 8. USAAs home of the tech capital, Silicon Valley, the United States should be a shoe-in for the Digital Nomad scheme. But the country is more used to exporting talent than importing it, and there is currently no visa available for remote workers to live out their American dream. The US is not the most welcoming. It’s a challenge to find a long-term work permit, as many of the programmes only cater to specific roles and degree-holders. Still, most remote workers will qualify to work in the country for up to six months with the B-1 Business Visa. 9. CanadaSnowy Canada is often included on lists of the ‘best countries for digital nomads’, so you might be surprised to see it featured here. But even though the so-called Great White North still doesn’t have an official Digital Nomad visa, it’s certainly speaking to them. Last year, Canada unveiled its Tech Talent Strategy, a new immigration initiative to allow temporary tech workers to work remotely in the country for up to six months. And the best part? During this time, employees only need visitor status, so you won’t even need to apply. 10. VietnamAbundant natural wonders, unique cuisine, and tens of historic towns and cities has made Vietnam one of the best-known tourist destinations. It’s also increasingly called home by thousands of remote workers across the globe, despite not having any Digital Nomad visa. Many pass through Vietnam on their way to other destinations in southeast Asia, such as Bali and Thailand, which is why they apply for the Business Visa. It permits holders to work for a total of 90 days, and is valid for up to one year with unlimited entry into Vietnam. 11. New ZealandYou can’t get much further away from the UK than New Zealand; the home of Hobbiton and Russell Crowe is the ideal destination for those who love travelling. And, while it doesn’t yet have a Digital Nomad visa, there are signs it could plan to announce one soon. New Zealand’s ruling party, the National Party, has begun outlining early plans to introduce a one-year long visa scheme, admitting 250 applicants to begin with. No official launch date for the scheme has yet been announced. In the meantime, Brits should content themselves with New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Learn about the potential New Zealand Digital Nomad visa and what we know so far.</td>\n",

       "      <td>New Zealand, also known as Aotearoa or “land of the long white cloud”, is considering introducing a Digital Nomad visa to open up the country to wanderlusting remote workers. If it is announced, the scheme would make New Zealand the first country in the Oceania continent to welcome tech-enabled and self-employed workers to its islands. It would join Japan, Italy, and Thailand, all of which unveiled their own Digital Nomad visas this year. Few details have been announced so far, but we do know that the New Zealand visa scheme would enable nomadic employees to live and work in the country for at least a year. In January, The Economist forecast there could be one billion digital nomads by 2035. NZ will “start small” with Digital Nomad schemeDigital nomads are workers who can carry out their job in any location. As a result, many choose to travel abroad and see the world while working, which is why so many countries have begun to introduce specific Digital Nomad visa programmes. Back in March, New Zealand’s newly-elected Immigration Minister Erica Stanford confirmed that the country’s government was considering a visa scheme for digital nomads. During its recent election campaign, the now-ruling National Party indicated it would begin by offering up to 250 visas to foreign employees, as a kind of soft launch to gauge interest. The proposed scheme would allow them to live and work in New Zealand for employers based outside the country for up to 12 months. Based on other, similar schemes, it would likely have the following entry requirements:Valid passportMinimum incomeHealth insuranceNo criminal recordScheme will target startups and software expertsMahesh Muralidhar, a National Party candidate who has been a prominent campaigner for the Digital Nomad visa, shared that he thought the scheme should cater to entrepreneurial tech experts and sole traders. “[For example], a software engineer who has worked at a large company and had one or two failed startups, or a designer coming here, mixing and mingling with our founders and entrepreneurs, ” he told the New Zealand newspaper, The Post. Likely, the scheme will not be confined to just these occupations, however. Research by IT service provider Redcentric revealed that a range of professionals would be interested in quitting their job to work as a Digital Nomad. The report shows that accountants are most likely to want to move abroad, followed by IT technicians, software engineers, and teachers. “New Zealand will forever offer something truly special for anyone that comes here. We are incredibly lucky to have what we have and should take advantage of that, ” Muralidhar added. Tax concerns cause hold-upIt could be within New Zealand’s interest to introduce a Digital Nomad visa; not least because its own inhabitants are being lured away by rival schemes. Technology firm Cvapp recently found that, since 2019, there has been a 2700% increase in searches from New Zealanders using Google to find remote work. However, the scheme’s delivery appears to be getting caught on tax legislation. This has become a controversial topic in the Digital Nomad visa debate. Specialised visas often have tax concessions to entice applicants. But some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, complain this pushes up living costs for locals, while contributing little to regional economies. Robyn Walker, New Zealand Deloitte tax partner, agrees. “Obviously, we’re in a global war for talent but we still want people who are happy to pay their fair share, ” she told The Post. How can I work in New Zealand now? Stanford has declared that, while the National Party is open to the idea of a Digital Nomad visa, it is “unfortunately not as an immediate priority”. In the meantime, Brits who are interested in moving to the land of The Lord of the Rings must be content with applying to New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Technically, this scheme is meant for those who are employed by a New Zealand-based company. However, it is possible to work for a foreign employer on this visa. That said, after six months, you will legally be classed as a tax resident and will need to register for self-assessment in New Zealand (although because of the UK’s double taxation agreement, you will be able to claim tax relief). Failing that, New Zealand also offers an Accredited Employer Work Visa, which will allow employees to work for a local, accredited employer for up to five years. Keen as a Kiwi? Don’t worry, we’ll keep this page regularly updated with any new information related to the proposed New Zealand Digital Nomad visa.</td>\n",

Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards. The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100. The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024. “More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment. Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40% . Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office. However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events. Recruit to the office? Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8, 000 staff members in January, to 11, 500 by the end of the year. Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants, a cafe, and outdoor terrace space. Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members. Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London. Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”. Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home. Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate. Rather than penalise staff for working from home, the investment in the YY London building suggests the brand thinks rewards, incentives and a new environment will improve office attendance. It remains to be seen if Revolut’s planned events and workshops will prove exciting enough to keep hybrid teams returning to the office, and encourage new team members to join them.

But new data suggests that the upper limits of creativity are being curbed by the government, as profanity-loving business owners come up against the censorship of Companies House. In total, 766 business names were rejected in 2023, with swearing being the main offence. According to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by 1st Formations, curse words made up 24% of business name applications rejected by Companies House last year. Companies House has strict rules about what is and is not allowed in a firm’s title. But experts are now cautioning that the government’s laws on registering a trademark or name might be behind the times with Brits’ love of a good swear word. ‘Doofus’ too rude to be registered as a company nameEntrepreneurs might be curious about just how profanity-laden their business name idea needs to be for Companies House to turn it down. As the 1st Formations findings suggest, even a mildly offensive term might be enough to earn entrepreneurs a rejection letter. Blasphemous business names rejected by Companies House in 2023 include:Little Pricks Tattoo StudioWtf Where’s The FoodPhat Phuc Noodle Bar LtdSee You Next Tuesday LtdForkin Recruitment LtdFukin Takeaway LtdFukim LtdFart LimitedCfuk LimitedInsults that wouldn’t be out of place on a primary school playground can be turned down by Companies House. Just ask the owner of ‘Doofus Dream Cars Limited’ and ‘Lmao Ltd’, both of which were rejected as expletives. Of the 188 business names rejected for swearing, ‘crap’ was also a common occurrence within the list, with names like ‘Crappy Nappy’ and ‘Scrap Your Crap Ltd’ both turned down. This is despite the eco-friendly toilet paper brand, ‘Who Gives A Crap? ’, which is based in Australia, announcing it achieved record UK sales this week, suggesting that Aussie attitudes to swearing are more relaxed than the British government. Companies House needs bringing “up to date”Earlier this year, data compiled by US recommendation service Enjoy Movies Your Way found that the annual number of swear words across mainstream TV shows and films in Western media has surged from fewer than 5, 000 in 1985, to over 60, 000 last year. Linguists today argue that swear words are becoming more acceptable in the UK, and are today used merely to emphasise points rather than cause offence. This language transformation could be why Companies House’s strict policies on supposedly rude names now feel out of touch with modern society. 1st Formations’ Director, Nicholas Campion, argues the list shows the government has an “outdated assessment process. ”“Companies House [may] need to bring itself up to date with modern language usage, as the Oxford English Dictionary has done, and, while we’re at it, accommodate the Great British sense of humour, ” he adds. There could be a real business incentive to adopting a punny business name. Last year, a consumer survey by BusinessNameGenerator showed that 64% of Brits would be more likely to notice and remember a funny company name, which could lead to a boost in sales. How to choose a business nameProfanity was not the only reason for business names being rejected in 2023. The 1st Formations data sorts the list into six prohibited categories:Profanity – 24% Drug references – 16% Sexual content – 15% Violence – 11% Discrimination – 8% Uncategorised – 26% Here are some examples of the kind of organisation names that are forbidden by Companies House for the above reasons:Rejected business nameReason for rejectionHorny Brew LtdSexual contentThe Prince Albert LtdSexual contentJerk Off Chicken LimitedSexual contentDank Productions LtdDrug referencesColin Bakes Dope (Responsibly) Ltd’Drug referencesW H Spliff LtdDrug referencesRagnarok Knives LtdViolencePsycho Traders LtdViolenceKiller Instinct LtdViolenceAryan Boss LtdDiscriminationKKK Properties LtdDiscriminationThere are also a number of other reasons why a company name may be rejected by Companies House, such as excluding “Limited”, “Ltd”, “Cyfyngedig”, “Cyf” or if the name lacks uniqueness or is too similar to another company. For example, W H Spliff would likely be considered objectionable even without the drugs reference, thanks to its similarity to the name of a certain, well-known UK retail chain. Campion advises that “if your proposed company name is similar or identical to a name already registered, Companies House will likely reject the application. ”Registering a company name is a fundamental step when setting up a new firm.

Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer unveiled the new pledges as part of the Labour Party’s official manifesto, titled Change, in Greater Manchester earlier today. Similar to gender pay gap reporting, the legislation would make it mandatory for firms to report on the pay disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff in a workforce. Racial Inequality ActThe principle that all workers, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or disability, are entitled to equal pay for equal work was first set out in the Equal Pay Act. However, the existing legislation does not currently require businesses to divulge the difference in pay for ethnicity. That could soon change if the Labour Party, which is currently winning in UK polls, comes into power. In his speech, Starmer confirmed plans to introduce a new Racial Inequality Act. According to Labour’s manifesto, this would “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people. ”Similar to the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information), the new laws would require some firms to publish specific ethnicity payroll data to reveal any wage disparities. Exact details on how the reporting process would work have not yet been revealed. Based on the current rules for gender pay gap reporting, only organisations with more than 250 employees (classed as large businesses in the UK) would need to publish the data. When comparing average hourly pay for minority ethnic versus white employees, data from the Office for National Statistics shows a mean pay gap of 25. 8% . Disability pay gapAs well as asking large businesses to report on the difference in pay between ethnic minority employees, Labour has also vowed to support more disabled employees in the UK, by requiring companies to publish data on the Disability Pay Gap. Disabled employees are often unable to work full-time, or are forced to go on long-term sickness absence, due to their disability, resulting in lower average wages overall. They also might face barriers and discrimination in employment. In November 2023, TUC analysis of data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that the difference in average earnings between disabled and non-disabled workers is now 14. 6% . This is 5. 5% greater than the gender pay gap between men and women. Starmer also said the party would seek to make disability hate crime an “aggravated offence” and “tackle the Access to Work backlog”. DWP figures show that the number of disabled people waiting for a decision on their Access to Work claim reached 25, 063 by December 2023. Awareness grows of UK pay inequalityLabour has not signalled if it would extend the pledge to cover sexual orientation. On average, LGBTQ+ workers in the UK earn £6, 700 less than their straight counterparts, contributing to a LGBTQ+ Pay Gap. Similarly, it has given no word on the Class Pay Gap, which refers to the difference in pay among workers from different social backgrounds, and few UK employers report on. Still, the decision to introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap data has been welcomed by experts. Melissa Blissett, Pay Gap Analytics Lead at Barnett Waddingham, said it sent “a clear message of fair pay, fair progression, and reward for the workplace. ”However, Blissett also cautioned that “lessons also need to be learnt from gender pay gap reporting”, opining that “reporting itself is not enough to change the dial. ”“Going beyond the reporting figures and analysing the underlying data to monitor trends, progress, potential blockers and drivers of the pay gap will be important, ” she added.   \n",
       "3     Digital Nomad visas have taken the world by storm. Well, most of it. While 50 countries now have visa programmes specifically for tech and freelance workers, others lag behind. Dreamy destinations such as Japan, Italy, and Thailand have all rolled out their own Digital Nomad-specific schemes this year. Their governments are catching onto the benefits that nomadic workers bring, such as a boost to tourism and the creation of knowledge clusters. But remote workers are still waiting for big-names such as the United States and Australia, and ten countries in the EU, to announce their own schemes. Below, we’ve listed the most sought-after remote work countries that don’t yet offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the alternative work permits that nomadic employees can apply for. 1. UKDespite considerable demand from Brits to work abroad, the UK still doesn’t have its own Digital Nomad visa. We’re also unlikely to announce it anytime soon. Our visa process is highly complex, and the government faces mounting pressure to curb migration numbers. In December, Whitehall raised the minimum income requirement for a skilled overseas worker to £38, 000, making it much more difficult for companies to hire foreign talent. The rules are not much better for short-term stays. As of December 2023, visitors to the UK can now engage in remote work tasks (such as answering emails or taking business calls) on their travel visas, but it cannot be the primary reason for their visit. Read about eight countries that are beating the UK in the race for global tech talent. 2. AustriaLocated on the Eastern Alps, Austria would be a dream deskspace for ski lovers. There’s no Digital Nomad visa available in the country yet. However, there are a number of visa schemes that interested workers and business owners can apply for. They include the Red-White-Red Card for those wanting to launch a business in Austria, and the Schengen Visa, a joined-up scheme that allows you to stay and work in up to 27 EU countries. You’ll be able to spend up to 90 days in each country for a total of 180 days. 3. BelgiumIt gave the world french fries, but teams will need to wait for an official Belgian Digital Nomad visa. It is currently illegal to work in the country as a tourist, and no word has been given yet as to when, and if, a remote working visa is on the cards for the Belgium government. Thankfully, there are still ways you can work in the country of chocolate, waffles, and beer if you’re a sole trader. The Belgium Professional Card, also known as the Freelance Visa or D-Visa, allows freelancers to pursue self-employed work while visiting Belgium. 4. DenmarkDenmark came out on top in the 2023 Global Remote Work Index by network provider Nordlayer. Judges praised the country for its low crime rate and digital infrastructure. But what they didn’t mention is that Denmark doesn’t actually have a Digital Nomad visa. Instead, as with Austria, tech-enabled employees and freelancers who want to live and work in Denmark can apply for a 90-day Schengen Visa to access the land of Lego. Working in Denmark without a work permit is illegal, so this programme is your safest route. 5. FranceFrance received the most visa requests in the last decade, and it is consistently voted as one of the favourite destinations for visa applicants. But the country still does not offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the government has also made no provisions for one. Francophiles can instead apply for the visa de long séjour (“long-stay visa”) to work in the country. It is valid for a period of three months to one year. According to the French government, around 130, 000 Brits applied for the scheme in 2023. 6. NetherlandsThe Netherlands is a lot more than its postcard image suggests. As well as windmills and tulip fields, the country is also a hub of action for remote workers, many of whom flock to the country for the Netherlands Startup Visa, which is a great alternative for digital nomads. Similar to Austria’s Red-White-Red card, the scheme allows foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a one-year temporary residence permit, during which they can launch an “innovative” product or service from their new, Dutch base. 7. AustraliaYou’ll likely already know an expat who had made the great move down under. Thousands of Brits are being drawn to Australia’s warm climate, trendy cities, and beachside lifestyle. As of now, Aussies do not offer an official Digital Nomad visa for remote employees. One outback-route into the country, though, is the Visitor Visa. This is for tourists who would like to live and work in Australia, but don’t sing to the sound of six months of farm work. This visa can be valid for up to one year, and costs an estimated £99 to apply for. 8. USAAs home of the tech capital, Silicon Valley, the United States should be a shoe-in for the Digital Nomad scheme. But the country is more used to exporting talent than importing it, and there is currently no visa available for remote workers to live out their American dream. The US is not the most welcoming. It’s a challenge to find a long-term work permit, as many of the programmes only cater to specific roles and degree-holders. Still, most remote workers will qualify to work in the country for up to six months with the B-1 Business Visa. 9. CanadaSnowy Canada is often included on lists of the ‘best countries for digital nomads’, so you might be surprised to see it featured here. But even though the so-called Great White North still doesn’t have an official Digital Nomad visa, it’s certainly speaking to them. Last year, Canada unveiled its Tech Talent Strategy, a new immigration initiative to allow temporary tech workers to work remotely in the country for up to six months. And the best part? During this time, employees only need visitor status, so you won’t even need to apply. 10. VietnamAbundant natural wonders, unique cuisine, and tens of historic towns and cities has made Vietnam one of the best-known tourist destinations. It’s also increasingly called home by thousands of remote workers across the globe, despite not having any Digital Nomad visa. Many pass through Vietnam on their way to other destinations in southeast Asia, such as Bali and Thailand, which is why they apply for the Business Visa. It permits holders to work for a total of 90 days, and is valid for up to one year with unlimited entry into Vietnam. 11. New ZealandYou can’t get much further away from the UK than New Zealand; the home of Hobbiton and Russell Crowe is the ideal destination for those who love travelling. And, while it doesn’t yet have a Digital Nomad visa, there are signs it could plan to announce one soon. New Zealand’s ruling party, the National Party, has begun outlining early plans to introduce a one-year long visa scheme, admitting 250 applicants to begin with. No official launch date for the scheme has yet been announced. In the meantime, Brits should content themselves with New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Learn about the potential New Zealand Digital Nomad visa and what we know so far.   \n",

If it is announced, the scheme would make New Zealand the first country in the Oceania continent to welcome tech-enabled and self-employed workers to its islands. It would join Japan, Italy, and Thailand, all of which unveiled their own Digital Nomad visas this year. Few details have been announced so far, but we do know that the New Zealand visa scheme would enable nomadic employees to live and work in the country for at least a year. In January, The Economist forecast there could be one billion digital nomads by 2035. NZ will “start small” with Digital Nomad schemeDigital nomads are workers who can carry out their job in any location. As a result, many choose to travel abroad and see the world while working, which is why so many countries have begun to introduce specific Digital Nomad visa programmes. Back in March, New Zealand’s newly-elected Immigration Minister Erica Stanford confirmed that the country’s government was considering a visa scheme for digital nomads. During its recent election campaign, the now-ruling National Party indicated it would begin by offering up to 250 visas to foreign employees, as a kind of soft launch to gauge interest. The proposed scheme would allow them to live and work in New Zealand for employers based outside the country for up to 12 months. Based on other, similar schemes, it would likely have the following entry requirements:Valid passportMinimum incomeHealth insuranceNo criminal recordScheme will target startups and software expertsMahesh Muralidhar, a National Party candidate who has been a prominent campaigner for the Digital Nomad visa, shared that he thought the scheme should cater to entrepreneurial tech experts and sole traders. “[For example], a software engineer who has worked at a large company and had one or two failed startups, or a designer coming here, mixing and mingling with our founders and entrepreneurs, ” he told the New Zealand newspaper, The Post. Likely, the scheme will not be confined to just these occupations, however. Research by IT service provider Redcentric revealed that a range of professionals would be interested in quitting their job to work as a Digital Nomad. The report shows that accountants are most likely to want to move abroad, followed by IT technicians, software engineers, and teachers. “New Zealand will forever offer something truly special for anyone that comes here. We are incredibly lucky to have what we have and should take advantage of that, ” Muralidhar added. Tax concerns cause hold-upIt could be within New Zealand’s interest to introduce a Digital Nomad visa; not least because its own inhabitants are being lured away by rival schemes. Technology firm Cvapp recently found that, since 2019, there has been a 2700% increase in searches from New Zealanders using Google to find remote work. However, the scheme’s delivery appears to be getting caught on tax legislation. This has become a controversial topic in the Digital Nomad visa debate. Specialised visas often have tax concessions to entice applicants. But some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, complain this pushes up living costs for locals, while contributing little to regional economies. Robyn Walker, New Zealand Deloitte tax partner, agrees. “Obviously, we’re in a global war for talent but we still want people who are happy to pay their fair share, ” she told The Post. How can I work in New Zealand now? Stanford has declared that, while the National Party is open to the idea of a Digital Nomad visa, it is “unfortunately not as an immediate priority”. In the meantime, Brits who are interested in moving to the land of The Lord of the Rings must be content with applying to New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Technically, this scheme is meant for those who are employed by a New Zealand-based company. However, it is possible to work for a foreign employer on this visa. That said, after six months, you will legally be classed as a tax resident and will need to register for self-assessment in New Zealand (although because of the UK’s double taxation agreement, you will be able to claim tax relief). Failing that, New Zealand also offers an Accredited Employer Work Visa, which will allow employees to work for a local, accredited employer for up to five years. Keen as a Kiwi?

                 Autosmart, one of the leading suppliers of vehicle cleaning products to the trade, has signed a new franchisee, Bruce Miller, to its network. Miller, who previously worked in retail management, has started operating for the franchise in Perthshire, Scotland and is already “looking forward to working in an industry that [he loves] and building a secure future to take [him] through to retirement”. Established in 1979, Autosmart offers an owner-operator, van-based business opportunity and specialises in range of car products, including truck wash, car polish, and workshop products, which it distributes to a range of clients such as car dealerships and haulage companies. The vehicle cleaning specialist is a long-established franchise company with a mature franchise network in the UK. From time to time resale opportunities become available due to retirement; offering “an exciting and rare business opportunity” to invest in a business with an established profitable customer base. It is also looking to expand globally having recently welcomed several new international franchisees. Miller discussed his reasons for joining the Autosmart brand:“I took voluntary redundancy following 19 years […] in the communications sector and decided to seek out a completely new career path, ideally running my own business. “I took some time out and completed a nut and bolt restoration of my 1965 Austin Healy car and decided to show it off at the annual summer show. I got into a conversation with the Autosmart franchisee for Aberdeen, Frank Sutherland, who was attending the show. He gave me a great insight into the business and life as a franchisee. “After attending a one-to-one discovery day at Autosmart’s head office, I continued my research with some field days out with neighbouring franchisees and the rest is history!”For more information on Autosmart’s re-sale franchise vacancies, contact 01543 482926 or click here.   \n",

index, has announced that it is to merge with competitor children’s sports franchise Sports Xtra in a deal which will enable both chains to enhance their franchise offering, working under the parent company of Sports Xtra (Franchising) Ltd). Members of the British Franchise Association (bfa), the merger will see Sports Xtra’s managing director Rob Oyston and A-Star Sports co-founders Gary and Sharon Bassett form the new senior management team to “take both brands forward”. Founded in 2011, A-Star Sports runs a range of kids sports clubs for children and has been backed by Theo Paphitis and Lord Young. Sports Xtra, founded in 2002 but launched as a franchise in 2008, offers a similar service with 400 coaches across the UK. As a result of the merger, the franchise will now combine a range of popular children’s physical activities ‘Xperiences” alongside the A-Star Sport multi-sports programme for children aged three to 12 years-old. The sports chains says the merger will enable the existing and prospective franchisees to benefit from “two strong brands, a wider product range, a knowledgeable call centre, an industry-specific data management system, award-winning social media, marketing and PR and a head office team with more time and expertise to support them. ”A-Star Sports’ Gary Bassett explained: “With our joint portfolio appealing directly to families, there is a lot of scope to work with other high profile brands to inspire and develop new, innovative ways to engage children. The aspiration to continually motivate and support young children to be the best they can be physically, emotionally and socially through high quality coaching and a commitment to exceptional customer service remains core to our business. ”Oyston of Sports Xtra added:“With a joint network of over 40 franchise territories and a growing support team, this is an exciting opportunity to reach out more widely to families with our unique products. ”   \n",

The store was acquired by serial franchisee Gurnek Singh; following a growing trend of franchisees opening multiple stores. The news follows the recent announcement that franchisee Dan Wilkinson has just opened his sixth Papa John’s in the North West of England. Gurnek Singh joined Papa John’s in 2011 and also oversees stores in Rugby, Leamington Spar and Sheffield. Singh said that running multiple stores is almost easier than managing one as you have a bigger team to help you, adding that he is excited at the opportunities opening in Banbury offers the business and the wider community:“As well as creating more jobs, opening more stores means increased sales… the store is in a popular location and we are very much looking forward to serving up some great pizza for the local community!”Papa John is the world’s largest pizza franchise after originating in the US in 1984. The global franchise has more than 4, 300 stores worldwide and hopes to expand its UK presence further with more UK franchise opportunities available. The average cost of a franchise falls between £177, 000 and £225, 000 (excluding VAT and freehold, and of which £70, 000 should be liquid funds. )Business development manager Anthony Round explains the benefits of multi-store franchises:“There are advantages of economies of scale by running more than one outlet and it offers the chance for expansion using a formula franchisees know works well. “Once a franchisee becomes confident in managing one store, we can help them apply that knowledge to open multiple outlets if they wish. We are also able to offer some great incentive deals to help ambitious franchisees expand in this way. ”Additional information on franchise opportunities and packages can be found on the brand’s website.   \n",

       "      <td>An innovative new game to help entrepreneurs risk-assess their business ventures has been launched via LinkedIn. The ‘snakes and ladders’-style game was devised by AXA Business Insurance after its research suggested that many new business owners start up without properly assessing the risks they may face – or taking steps to safeguard their start-up. The new online game can be played using LinkedIn login details, and helps players assess their insurance needs with a series of true or false questions. Players can compare their scores with their LinkedIn contacts, to aid discussions and advice sharing on the topic. Amanda Blanc, CEO of AXA Commercial Lines, said: “New businesses are the backbone of our economy and will help drive us forward. “They need to be as prepared for the risks they may face as they grow, by taking out protection. ”Regarding the specific target audience, Blanc added: “This online game is designed to encourage small businesses – particularly those just getting off the ground – to think about the risks and [how] to ensure their business climbs the ladder of opportunity, rather than falls down following unexpected disaster. “It’s intended to be a fun way of getting a serious message across: without the right protection, a small business may not survive a pitfall. ”</td>\n",

The Berti Green Accelerator is offering three green entrepreneurs “the full toolkit needed to succeed in growing a successful and meaningful business” – including funding of up to £1m each and business support and expertise from James Caan’s Hamilton Bradshaw Impact Partners (HBIP). Seth Tabatznik, director of Berti Investments, said that while socially or environmentally conscious entrepreneurs frequently have the vision and passion to make a difference, they often lack the business know-how to make their idea really appealing to investors. He told Startups: “With global concerns around climate change and social inequality increasingly emerging on the mainstream agenda, great innovative start-ups are appearing all round the world…creating enterprises that aim to make a difference. “But two significant barriers stop social entrepreneurs in their tracks: funding and support. Here in the UK, while investor confidence in the green industry remains low, businesses need to prove their skills to be a head above the rest in order to attract funding in this increasingly competitive landscape. ”The accelerator offers what Caan refers to as “intelligent capital”. As well as funding, the three winners will receive six months’ worth of business support from HBIP, covering every aspect of running a business, helping them to create the right management processes and structure, forge strong business relationships and build a strong brand. The judges will be looking for green businesses that can demonstrate both a sustainable approach to carbon reduction, and a scalable and profitable business model.

       "      <td>The government has launched a new scheme offering loans to young entrepreneurs, to help them start-up successful businesses. The £82. 5m StartUp Loans scheme, which was proposed by Sir Richard Branson last year and confirmed in this year’s Budget, will offer finance and support to entrepreneurs aged 18-24, in a bid to kickstart more businesses and tackle youth unemployment in the UK. Applicants will receive advice and guidance, with the most promising going on to receive formal mentoring and training, including help with developing a business plan. Those with “robust and approved” plans will be eligible for loans of around £2, 500. Unlike student loans, the maximum repayment terms on offer will be five years, while the interest rate will be set at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3% , with all repayments and interest channelled back into a central pot to support other young entrepreneurs. Commenting on the scheme, which forms part of the government’s ongoing ‘Business in You’ campaign, Prime Minister David Cameron said: “I want this to be the year where people can think yes, I can do it, that we can get as many viable businesses as possible off the ground, that people can have a go, and that we see a whole new wave of entrepreneurs who start small but think big. ”StartUp Loans will kick off with a £10m pilot this financial year; if successful, the scheme will be bolstered by a further £32. 5m in 2013/14, and £40m in 2014/15. PartnersThe loans will be administered by a handful of ‘delivery partners’ – organisations with experience in helping young people start businesses – such as the Prince’s Trust. These partners will provide support and mentoring, assess the viability of young people’s business plans, and manage repayments. James Caan, entrepreneur and former ‘Dragon’, will chair a new body set up by the government to oversee the scheme, with other board members including Duncan Cheatle, founder of The Supper Club, and Julie Meyer, founder of Ariadne Capital. Caan said: “The StartUp Loans initiative provides guidance, access to expertise, and finance. These are the three vital ingredients for starting your own business. ”Young entrepreneursOne young entrepreneur hoping to benefit from the scheme is Kaylie Hill, a 23-year-old graduate from Swindon, who has struggled to access the funding she needs to get her business – a women’s footwear fashion brand – off the ground. She said: “I approached the bank for funding but they said I needed to improve my credit rating. As I had been a student up until that point, I hadn’t had the opportunity. “I approached the Princes Trust, but they said I had to be unemployed to qualify – I couldn’t afford to lose my job or I wouldn’t be able to live. “I even looked into angel investment, but I found [this was more suitable] for bigger investments and they would want a portion of my business – which is not for me. ”If successful, Kaylie plans to use the loan to buy material to make her first collection, to take to potential stockists. Lord Young reportToday’s launch also coincides with a new report by Lord Young, the government’s enterprise adviser and the ‘Godfather of StartUp Loans’, which found that if the UK were to match the rate of entrepreneurship in the US, we would have 900, 000 more businesses. The report also argues that the internet, along with the amount of support available for those looking to start a business today, has significantly lowered the barriers to entry for entrepreneurship, meaning that now is “a great time to start a business”.</td>\n",

       "      <td>New Zealand, also known as Aotearoa or “land of the long white cloud”, is considering introducing a Digital Nomad visa to open up the country to wanderlusting remote workers. If it is announced, the scheme would make New Zealand the first country in the Oceania continent to welcome tech-enabled and self-employed workers to its islands. It would join Japan, Italy, and Thailand, all of which unveiled their own Digital Nomad visas this year. Few details have been announced so far, but we do know that the New Zealand visa scheme would enable nomadic employees to live and work in the country for at least a year. In January, The Economist forecast there could be one billion digital nomads by 2035. NZ will “start small” with Digital Nomad schemeDigital nomads are workers who can carry out their job in any location. As a result, many choose to travel abroad and see the world while working, which is why so many countries have begun to introduce specific Digital Nomad visa programmes. Back in March, New Zealand’s newly-elected Immigration Minister Erica Stanford confirmed that the country’s government was considering a visa scheme for digital nomads. During its recent election campaign, the now-ruling National Party indicated it would begin by offering up to 250 visas to foreign employees, as a kind of soft launch to gauge interest. The proposed scheme would allow them to live and work in New Zealand for employers based outside the country for up to 12 months. Based on other, similar schemes, it would likely have the following entry requirements:Valid passportMinimum incomeHealth insuranceNo criminal recordScheme will target startups and software expertsMahesh Muralidhar, a National Party candidate who has been a prominent campaigner for the Digital Nomad visa, shared that he thought the scheme should cater to entrepreneurial tech experts and sole traders. “[For example], a software engineer who has worked at a large company and had one or two failed startups, or a designer coming here, mixing and mingling with our founders and entrepreneurs, ” he told the New Zealand newspaper, The Post. Likely, the scheme will not be confined to just these occupations, however. Research by IT service provider Redcentric revealed that a range of professionals would be interested in quitting their job to work as a Digital Nomad. The report shows that accountants are most likely to want to move abroad, followed by IT technicians, software engineers, and teachers. “New Zealand will forever offer something truly special for anyone that comes here. We are incredibly lucky to have what we have and should take advantage of that, ” Muralidhar added. Tax concerns cause hold-upIt could be within New Zealand’s interest to introduce a Digital Nomad visa; not least because its own inhabitants are being lured away by rival schemes. Technology firm Cvapp recently found that, since 2019, there has been a 2700% increase in searches from New Zealanders using Google to find remote work. However, the scheme’s delivery appears to be getting caught on tax legislation. This has become a controversial topic in the Digital Nomad visa debate. Specialised visas often have tax concessions to entice applicants. But some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, complain this pushes up living costs for locals, while contributing little to regional economies. Robyn Walker, New Zealand Deloitte tax partner, agrees. “Obviously, we’re in a global war for talent but we still want people who are happy to pay their fair share, ” she told The Post. How can I work in New Zealand now? Stanford has declared that, while the National Party is open to the idea of a Digital Nomad visa, it is “unfortunately not as an immediate priority”. In the meantime, Brits who are interested in moving to the land of The Lord of the Rings must be content with applying to New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Technically, this scheme is meant for those who are employed by a New Zealand-based company. However, it is possible to work for a foreign employer on this visa. That said, after six months, you will legally be classed as a tax resident and will need to register for self-assessment in New Zealand (although because of the UK’s double taxation agreement, you will be able to claim tax relief). Failing that, New Zealand also offers an Accredited Employer Work Visa, which will allow employees to work for a local, accredited employer for up to five years. Keen as a Kiwi?

       "      <td>Digital Nomad visas have taken the world by storm. Well, most of it. While 50 countries now have visa programmes specifically for tech and freelance workers, others lag behind. Dreamy destinations such as Japan, Italy, and Thailand have all rolled out their own Digital Nomad-specific schemes this year. Their governments are catching onto the benefits that nomadic workers bring, such as a boost to tourism and the creation of knowledge clusters. But remote workers are still waiting for big-names such as the United States and Australia, and ten countries in the EU, to announce their own schemes. Below, we’ve listed the most sought-after remote work countries that don’t yet offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the alternative work permits that nomadic employees can apply for. 1. UKDespite considerable demand from Brits to work abroad, the UK still doesn’t have its own Digital Nomad visa. We’re also unlikely to announce it anytime soon. Our visa process is highly complex, and the government faces mounting pressure to curb migration numbers. In December, Whitehall raised the minimum income requirement for a skilled overseas worker to £38, 000, making it much more difficult for companies to hire foreign talent. The rules are not much better for short-term stays. As of December 2023, visitors to the UK can now engage in remote work tasks (such as answering emails or taking business calls) on their travel visas, but it cannot be the primary reason for their visit. Read about eight countries that are beating the UK in the race for global tech talent. 2. AustriaLocated on the Eastern Alps, Austria would be a dream deskspace for ski lovers. There’s no Digital Nomad visa available in the country yet. However, there are a number of visa schemes that interested workers and business owners can apply for. They include the Red-White-Red Card for those wanting to launch a business in Austria, and the Schengen Visa, a joined-up scheme that allows you to stay and work in up to 27 EU countries. You’ll be able to spend up to 90 days in each country for a total of 180 days. 3. BelgiumIt gave the world french fries, but teams will need to wait for an official Belgian Digital Nomad visa. It is currently illegal to work in the country as a tourist, and no word has been given yet as to when, and if, a remote working visa is on the cards for the Belgium government. Thankfully, there are still ways you can work in the country of chocolate, waffles, and beer if you’re a sole trader. The Belgium Professional Card, also known as the Freelance Visa or D-Visa, allows freelancers to pursue self-employed work while visiting Belgium. 4. DenmarkDenmark came out on top in the 2023 Global Remote Work Index by network provider Nordlayer. Judges praised the country for its low crime rate and digital infrastructure. But what they didn’t mention is that Denmark doesn’t actually have a Digital Nomad visa. Instead, as with Austria, tech-enabled employees and freelancers who want to live and work in Denmark can apply for a 90-day Schengen Visa to access the land of Lego. Working in Denmark without a work permit is illegal, so this programme is your safest route. 5. FranceFrance received the most visa requests in the last decade, and it is consistently voted as one of the favourite destinations for visa applicants. But the country still does not offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the government has also made no provisions for one. Francophiles can instead apply for the visa de long séjour (“long-stay visa”) to work in the country. It is valid for a period of three months to one year. According to the French government, around 130, 000 Brits applied for the scheme in 2023. 6. NetherlandsThe Netherlands is a lot more than its postcard image suggests. As well as windmills and tulip fields, the country is also a hub of action for remote workers, many of whom flock to the country for the Netherlands Startup Visa, which is a great alternative for digital nomads. Similar to Austria’s Red-White-Red card, the scheme allows foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a one-year temporary residence permit, during which they can launch an “innovative” product or service from their new, Dutch base. 7. AustraliaYou’ll likely already know an expat who had made the great move down under. Thousands of Brits are being drawn to Australia’s warm climate, trendy cities, and beachside lifestyle. As of now, Aussies do not offer an official Digital Nomad visa for remote employees. One outback-route into the country, though, is the Visitor Visa. This is for tourists who would like to live and work in Australia, but don’t sing to the sound of six months of farm work. This visa can be valid for up to one year, and costs an estimated £99 to apply for. 8. USAAs home of the tech capital, Silicon Valley, the United States should be a shoe-in for the Digital Nomad scheme. But the country is more used to exporting talent than importing it, and there is currently no visa available for remote workers to live out their American dream. The US is not the most welcoming. It’s a challenge to find a long-term work permit, as many of the programmes only cater to specific roles and degree-holders. Still, most remote workers will qualify to work in the country for up to six months with the B-1 Business Visa. 9. CanadaSnowy Canada is often included on lists of the ‘best countries for digital nomads’, so you might be surprised to see it featured here. But even though the so-called Great White North still doesn’t have an official Digital Nomad visa, it’s certainly speaking to them. Last year, Canada unveiled its Tech Talent Strategy, a new immigration initiative to allow temporary tech workers to work remotely in the country for up to six months. And the best part? During this time, employees only need visitor status, so you won’t even need to apply. 10. VietnamAbundant natural wonders, unique cuisine, and tens of historic towns and cities has made Vietnam one of the best-known tourist destinations. It’s also increasingly called home by thousands of remote workers across the globe, despite not having any Digital Nomad visa. Many pass through Vietnam on their way to other destinations in southeast Asia, such as Bali and Thailand, which is why they apply for the Business Visa. It permits holders to work for a total of 90 days, and is valid for up to one year with unlimited entry into Vietnam. 11. New ZealandYou can’t get much further away from the UK than New Zealand; the home of Hobbiton and Russell Crowe is the ideal destination for those who love travelling. And, while it doesn’t yet have a Digital Nomad visa, there are signs it could plan to announce one soon. New Zealand’s ruling party, the National Party, has begun outlining early plans to introduce a one-year long visa scheme, admitting 250 applicants to begin with. No official launch date for the scheme has yet been announced. In the meantime, Brits should content themselves with New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Learn about the potential New Zealand Digital Nomad visa and what we know so far.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Labour Party has said it will require all large businesses to publish an Ethnicity Pay Gap report, if it wins the UK general election on July 4. Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer unveiled the new pledges as part of the Labour Party’s official manifesto, titled Change, in Greater Manchester earlier today. Similar to gender pay gap reporting, the legislation would make it mandatory for firms to report on the pay disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff in a workforce. Racial Inequality ActThe principle that all workers, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or disability, are entitled to equal pay for equal work was first set out in the Equal Pay Act. However, the existing legislation does not currently require businesses to divulge the difference in pay for ethnicity. That could soon change if the Labour Party, which is currently winning in UK polls, comes into power. In his speech, Starmer confirmed plans to introduce a new Racial Inequality Act. According to Labour’s manifesto, this would “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people. ”Similar to the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information), the new laws would require some firms to publish specific ethnicity payroll data to reveal any wage disparities. Exact details on how the reporting process would work have not yet been revealed. Based on the current rules for gender pay gap reporting, only organisations with more than 250 employees (classed as large businesses in the UK) would need to publish the data. When comparing average hourly pay for minority ethnic versus white employees, data from the Office for National Statistics shows a mean pay gap of 25. 8% . Disability pay gapAs well as asking large businesses to report on the difference in pay between ethnic minority employees, Labour has also vowed to support more disabled employees in the UK, by requiring companies to publish data on the Disability Pay Gap. Disabled employees are often unable to work full-time, or are forced to go on long-term sickness absence, due to their disability, resulting in lower average wages overall. They also might face barriers and discrimination in employment. In November 2023, TUC analysis of data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that the difference in average earnings between disabled and non-disabled workers is now 14. 6% . This is 5. 5% greater than the gender pay gap between men and women. Starmer also said the party would seek to make disability hate crime an “aggravated offence” and “tackle the Access to Work backlog”. DWP figures show that the number of disabled people waiting for a decision on their Access to Work claim reached 25, 063 by December 2023. Awareness grows of UK pay inequalityLabour has not signalled if it would extend the pledge to cover sexual orientation. On average, LGBTQ+ workers in the UK earn £6, 700 less than their straight counterparts, contributing to a LGBTQ+ Pay Gap. Similarly, it has given no word on the Class Pay Gap, which refers to the difference in pay among workers from different social backgrounds, and few UK employers report on. Still, the decision to introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap data has been welcomed by experts. Melissa Blissett, Pay Gap Analytics Lead at Barnett Waddingham, said it sent “a clear message of fair pay, fair progression, and reward for the workplace. ”However, Blissett also cautioned that “lessons also need to be learnt from gender pay gap reporting”, opining that “reporting itself is not enough to change the dial. ”“Going beyond the reporting figures and analysing the underlying data to monitor trends, progress, potential blockers and drivers of the pay gap will be important, ” she added.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Choosing a business name requires a bit of creative thinking. But new data suggests that the upper limits of creativity are being curbed by the government, as profanity-loving business owners come up against the censorship of Companies House. In total, 766 business names were rejected in 2023, with swearing being the main offence. According to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by 1st Formations, curse words made up 24% of business name applications rejected by Companies House last year. Companies House has strict rules about what is and is not allowed in a firm’s title. But experts are now cautioning that the government’s laws on registering a trademark or name might be behind the times with Brits’ love of a good swear word. ‘Doofus’ too rude to be registered as a company nameEntrepreneurs might be curious about just how profanity-laden their business name idea needs to be for Companies House to turn it down. As the 1st Formations findings suggest, even a mildly offensive term might be enough to earn entrepreneurs a rejection letter. Blasphemous business names rejected by Companies House in 2023 include:Little Pricks Tattoo StudioWtf Where’s The FoodPhat Phuc Noodle Bar LtdSee You Next Tuesday LtdForkin Recruitment LtdFukin Takeaway LtdFukim LtdFart LimitedCfuk LimitedInsults that wouldn’t be out of place on a primary school playground can be turned down by Companies House. Just ask the owner of ‘Doofus Dream Cars Limited’ and ‘Lmao Ltd’, both of which were rejected as expletives. Of the 188 business names rejected for swearing, ‘crap’ was also a common occurrence within the list, with names like ‘Crappy Nappy’ and ‘Scrap Your Crap Ltd’ both turned down. This is despite the eco-friendly toilet paper brand, ‘Who Gives A Crap? ’, which is based in Australia, announcing it achieved record UK sales this week, suggesting that Aussie attitudes to swearing are more relaxed than the British government. Companies House needs bringing “up to date”Earlier this year, data compiled by US recommendation service Enjoy Movies Your Way found that the annual number of swear words across mainstream TV shows and films in Western media has surged from fewer than 5, 000 in 1985, to over 60, 000 last year. Linguists today argue that swear words are becoming more acceptable in the UK, and are today used merely to emphasise points rather than cause offence. This language transformation could be why Companies House’s strict policies on supposedly rude names now feel out of touch with modern society. 1st Formations’ Director, Nicholas Campion, argues the list shows the government has an “outdated assessment process. ”“Companies House [may] need to bring itself up to date with modern language usage, as the Oxford English Dictionary has done, and, while we’re at it, accommodate the Great British sense of humour, ” he adds. There could be a real business incentive to adopting a punny business name. Last year, a consumer survey by BusinessNameGenerator showed that 64% of Brits would be more likely to notice and remember a funny company name, which could lead to a boost in sales. How to choose a business nameProfanity was not the only reason for business names being rejected in 2023. The 1st Formations data sorts the list into six prohibited categories:Profanity – 24% Drug references – 16% Sexual content – 15% Violence – 11% Discrimination – 8% Uncategorised – 26% Here are some examples of the kind of organisation names that are forbidden by Companies House for the above reasons:Rejected business nameReason for rejectionHorny Brew LtdSexual contentThe Prince Albert LtdSexual contentJerk Off Chicken LimitedSexual contentDank Productions LtdDrug referencesColin Bakes Dope (Responsibly) Ltd’Drug referencesW H Spliff LtdDrug referencesRagnarok Knives LtdViolencePsycho Traders LtdViolenceKiller Instinct LtdViolenceAryan Boss LtdDiscriminationKKK Properties LtdDiscriminationThere are also a number of other reasons why a company name may be rejected by Companies House, such as excluding “Limited”, “Ltd”, “Cyfyngedig”, “Cyf” or if the name lacks uniqueness or is too similar to another company. For example, W H Spliff would likely be considered objectionable even without the drugs reference, thanks to its similarity to the name of a certain, well-known UK retail chain. Campion advises that “if your proposed company name is similar or identical to a name already registered, Companies House will likely reject the application. ”Registering a company name is a fundamental step when setting up a new firm.

       "      <td>Fintech darling and former Startups 100 winner Revolut has signed a 10-year lease with the YY London building in Canary Wharf. Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards. The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100. The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024. “More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment. Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40% . Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office. However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events. Recruit to the office? Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8, 000 staff members in January, to 11, 500 by the end of the year. Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants, a cafe, and outdoor terrace space. Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members. Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London. Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”. Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home. Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate. Rather than penalise staff for working from home, the investment in the YY London building suggests the brand thinks rewards, incentives and a new environment will improve office attendance. It remains to be seen if Revolut’s planned events and workshops will prove exciting enough to keep hybrid teams returning to the office, and encourage new team members to join them.

                                       An innovative new game to help entrepreneurs risk-assess their business ventures has been launched via LinkedIn. The ‘snakes and ladders’-style game was devised by AXA Business Insurance after its research suggested that many new business owners start up without properly assessing the risks they may face – or taking steps to safeguard their start-up. The new online game can be played using LinkedIn login details, and helps players assess their insurance needs with a series of true or false questions. Players can compare their scores with their LinkedIn contacts, to aid discussions and advice sharing on the topic. Amanda Blanc, CEO of AXA Commercial Lines, said: “New businesses are the backbone of our economy and will help drive us forward. “They need to be as prepared for the risks they may face as they grow, by taking out protection. ”Regarding the specific target audience, Blanc added: “This online game is designed to encourage small businesses – particularly those just getting off the ground – to think about the risks and [how] to ensure their business climbs the ladder of opportunity, rather than falls down following unexpected disaster. “It’s intended to be a fun way of getting a serious message across: without the right protection, a small business may not survive a pitfall. ”   \n",

Marketinvoice celebrates £1m-December with international expansionFinancial e-commerce site Marketinvoice has announced plans to expand into Asia, less than a year after its launch. The start-up – which allows suppliers to ease cashflow woes by auctioning outstanding invoices – is setting up a liaison office in Hong Kong, after spotting demand for international invoice auctioning. The move follows a record month of trading for Marketinvoice in December, when the site helped small businesses access over £1m in finance. The founders expect their clients to auction up to $5m (£3. 1m) through the site in 2012. The fore-mentioned businesses are all among those chosen as our Top 20 start-ups of 2011   \n",

The Berti Green Accelerator is offering three green entrepreneurs “the full toolkit needed to succeed in growing a successful and meaningful business” – including funding of up to £1m each and business support and expertise from James Caan’s Hamilton Bradshaw Impact Partners (HBIP). Seth Tabatznik, director of Berti Investments, said that while socially or environmentally conscious entrepreneurs frequently have the vision and passion to make a difference, they often lack the business know-how to make their idea really appealing to investors. He told Startups: “With global concerns around climate change and social inequality increasingly emerging on the mainstream agenda, great innovative start-ups are appearing all round the world…creating enterprises that aim to make a difference. “But two significant barriers stop social entrepreneurs in their tracks: funding and support. Here in the UK, while investor confidence in the green industry remains low, businesses need to prove their skills to be a head above the rest in order to attract funding in this increasingly competitive landscape. ”The accelerator offers what Caan refers to as “intelligent capital”. As well as funding, the three winners will receive six months’ worth of business support from HBIP, covering every aspect of running a business, helping them to create the right management processes and structure, forge strong business relationships and build a strong brand. The judges will be looking for green businesses that can demonstrate both a sustainable approach to carbon reduction, and a scalable and profitable business model. Applications for the Berti Green Accelerator close at 8pm on Tuesday 17 April 2012. For more information and to apply, visit the Berti Investments website   \n",

The £82. 5m StartUp Loans scheme, which was proposed by Sir Richard Branson last year and confirmed in this year’s Budget, will offer finance and support to entrepreneurs aged 18-24, in a bid to kickstart more businesses and tackle youth unemployment in the UK. Applicants will receive advice and guidance, with the most promising going on to receive formal mentoring and training, including help with developing a business plan. Those with “robust and approved” plans will be eligible for loans of around £2, 500. Unlike student loans, the maximum repayment terms on offer will be five years, while the interest rate will be set at the Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3% , with all repayments and interest channelled back into a central pot to support other young entrepreneurs. Commenting on the scheme, which forms part of the government’s ongoing ‘Business in You’ campaign, Prime Minister David Cameron said: “I want this to be the year where people can think yes, I can do it, that we can get as many viable businesses as possible off the ground, that people can have a go, and that we see a whole new wave of entrepreneurs who start small but think big. ”StartUp Loans will kick off with a £10m pilot this financial year; if successful, the scheme will be bolstered by a further £32. 5m in 2013/14, and £40m in 2014/15. PartnersThe loans will be administered by a handful of ‘delivery partners’ – organisations with experience in helping young people start businesses – such as the Prince’s Trust. These partners will provide support and mentoring, assess the viability of young people’s business plans, and manage repayments. James Caan, entrepreneur and former ‘Dragon’, will chair a new body set up by the government to oversee the scheme, with other board members including Duncan Cheatle, founder of The Supper Club, and Julie Meyer, founder of Ariadne Capital. Caan said: “The StartUp Loans initiative provides guidance, access to expertise, and finance. These are the three vital ingredients for starting your own business. ”Young entrepreneursOne young entrepreneur hoping to benefit from the scheme is Kaylie Hill, a 23-year-old graduate from Swindon, who has struggled to access the funding she needs to get her business – a women’s footwear fashion brand – off the ground. She said: “I approached the bank for funding but they said I needed to improve my credit rating. As I had been a student up until that point, I hadn’t had the opportunity. “I approached the Princes Trust, but they said I had to be unemployed to qualify – I couldn’t afford to lose my job or I wouldn’t be able to live. “I even looked into angel investment, but I found [this was more suitable] for bigger investments and they would want a portion of my business – which is not for me. ”If successful, Kaylie plans to use the loan to buy material to make her first collection, to take to potential stockists.

mobile merchants to take card payments anywhere. The firm, which is one of the largest independent payment processors in the UK, has teamed up with eMerit Solutions Limited to produce the device, which allows entrepreneurs to complete card transactions using the internet connection on their smartphone. The chip and pin device is expected to particularly appeal to merchants and retailers with a flexible working location, such as mobile hairdressers, taxi drivers, market stall traders and small businesses, such as cafes. SagePay Mobile launched a similar product earlier this year and the latest offering from HSBC – which is fully secure and compliant with all major card schemes – will become universally available by the end of 2012. Chris Davies, managing director of HSBC Merchant Services said: “The current economic climate has resulted in increased pressure on sole traders to retain loyal customers. “By accepting credit, debit and gift card payments through smartphones and mobile devices, the eMerit device gives merchants the ability to process payments that will ultimately drive forward repeat business – quickly and easily. ”   \n",

If it is announced, the scheme would make New Zealand the first country in the Oceania continent to welcome tech-enabled and self-employed workers to its islands. It would join Japan, Italy, and Thailand, all of which unveiled their own Digital Nomad visas this year. Few details have been announced so far, but we do know that the New Zealand visa scheme would enable nomadic employees to live and work in the country for at least a year. In January, The Economist forecast there could be one billion digital nomads by 2035. NZ will “start small” with Digital Nomad schemeDigital nomads are workers who can carry out their job in any location. As a result, many choose to travel abroad and see the world while working, which is why so many countries have begun to introduce specific Digital Nomad visa programmes. Back in March, New Zealand’s newly-elected Immigration Minister Erica Stanford confirmed that the country’s government was considering a visa scheme for digital nomads. During its recent election campaign, the now-ruling National Party indicated it would begin by offering up to 250 visas to foreign employees, as a kind of soft launch to gauge interest. The proposed scheme would allow them to live and work in New Zealand for employers based outside the country for up to 12 months. Based on other, similar schemes, it would likely have the following entry requirements:Valid passportMinimum incomeHealth insuranceNo criminal recordScheme will target startups and software expertsMahesh Muralidhar, a National Party candidate who has been a prominent campaigner for the Digital Nomad visa, shared that he thought the scheme should cater to entrepreneurial tech experts and sole traders. “[For example], a software engineer who has worked at a large company and had one or two failed startups, or a designer coming here, mixing and mingling with our founders and entrepreneurs, ” he told the New Zealand newspaper, The Post. Likely, the scheme will not be confined to just these occupations, however. Research by IT service provider Redcentric revealed that a range of professionals would be interested in quitting their job to work as a Digital Nomad. The report shows that accountants are most likely to want to move abroad, followed by IT technicians, software engineers, and teachers. “New Zealand will forever offer something truly special for anyone that comes here. We are incredibly lucky to have what we have and should take advantage of that, ” Muralidhar added. Tax concerns cause hold-upIt could be within New Zealand’s interest to introduce a Digital Nomad visa; not least because its own inhabitants are being lured away by rival schemes. Technology firm Cvapp recently found that, since 2019, there has been a 2700% increase in searches from New Zealanders using Google to find remote work. However, the scheme’s delivery appears to be getting caught on tax legislation. This has become a controversial topic in the Digital Nomad visa debate. Specialised visas often have tax concessions to entice applicants. But some countries, such as Mexico and Argentina, complain this pushes up living costs for locals, while contributing little to regional economies. Robyn Walker, New Zealand Deloitte tax partner, agrees. “Obviously, we’re in a global war for talent but we still want people who are happy to pay their fair share, ” she told The Post. How can I work in New Zealand now? Stanford has declared that, while the National Party is open to the idea of a Digital Nomad visa, it is “unfortunately not as an immediate priority”. In the meantime, Brits who are interested in moving to the land of The Lord of the Rings must be content with applying to New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Technically, this scheme is meant for those who are employed by a New Zealand-based company. However, it is possible to work for a foreign employer on this visa. That said, after six months, you will legally be classed as a tax resident and will need to register for self-assessment in New Zealand (although because of the UK’s double taxation agreement, you will be able to claim tax relief). Failing that, New Zealand also offers an Accredited Employer Work Visa, which will allow employees to work for a local, accredited employer for up to five years. Keen as a Kiwi?

       "3     Digital Nomad visas have taken the world by storm. Well, most of it. While 50 countries now have visa programmes specifically for tech and freelance workers, others lag behind. Dreamy destinations such as Japan, Italy, and Thailand have all rolled out their own Digital Nomad-specific schemes this year. Their governments are catching onto the benefits that nomadic workers bring, such as a boost to tourism and the creation of knowledge clusters. But remote workers are still waiting for big-names such as the United States and Australia, and ten countries in the EU, to announce their own schemes. Below, we’ve listed the most sought-after remote work countries that don’t yet offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the alternative work permits that nomadic employees can apply for. 1. UKDespite considerable demand from Brits to work abroad, the UK still doesn’t have its own Digital Nomad visa. We’re also unlikely to announce it anytime soon. Our visa process is highly complex, and the government faces mounting pressure to curb migration numbers. In December, Whitehall raised the minimum income requirement for a skilled overseas worker to £38, 000, making it much more difficult for companies to hire foreign talent. The rules are not much better for short-term stays. As of December 2023, visitors to the UK can now engage in remote work tasks (such as answering emails or taking business calls) on their travel visas, but it cannot be the primary reason for their visit. Read about eight countries that are beating the UK in the race for global tech talent. 2. AustriaLocated on the Eastern Alps, Austria would be a dream deskspace for ski lovers. There’s no Digital Nomad visa available in the country yet. However, there are a number of visa schemes that interested workers and business owners can apply for. They include the Red-White-Red Card for those wanting to launch a business in Austria, and the Schengen Visa, a joined-up scheme that allows you to stay and work in up to 27 EU countries. You’ll be able to spend up to 90 days in each country for a total of 180 days. 3. BelgiumIt gave the world french fries, but teams will need to wait for an official Belgian Digital Nomad visa. It is currently illegal to work in the country as a tourist, and no word has been given yet as to when, and if, a remote working visa is on the cards for the Belgium government. Thankfully, there are still ways you can work in the country of chocolate, waffles, and beer if you’re a sole trader. The Belgium Professional Card, also known as the Freelance Visa or D-Visa, allows freelancers to pursue self-employed work while visiting Belgium. 4. DenmarkDenmark came out on top in the 2023 Global Remote Work Index by network provider Nordlayer. Judges praised the country for its low crime rate and digital infrastructure. But what they didn’t mention is that Denmark doesn’t actually have a Digital Nomad visa. Instead, as with Austria, tech-enabled employees and freelancers who want to live and work in Denmark can apply for a 90-day Schengen Visa to access the land of Lego. Working in Denmark without a work permit is illegal, so this programme is your safest route. 5. FranceFrance received the most visa requests in the last decade, and it is consistently voted as one of the favourite destinations for visa applicants. But the country still does not offer a Digital Nomad visa, and the government has also made no provisions for one. Francophiles can instead apply for the visa de long séjour (“long-stay visa”) to work in the country. It is valid for a period of three months to one year. According to the French government, around 130, 000 Brits applied for the scheme in 2023. 6. NetherlandsThe Netherlands is a lot more than its postcard image suggests. As well as windmills and tulip fields, the country is also a hub of action for remote workers, many of whom flock to the country for the Netherlands Startup Visa, which is a great alternative for digital nomads. Similar to Austria’s Red-White-Red card, the scheme allows foreign entrepreneurs to apply for a one-year temporary residence permit, during which they can launch an “innovative” product or service from their new, Dutch base. 7. AustraliaYou’ll likely already know an expat who had made the great move down under. Thousands of Brits are being drawn to Australia’s warm climate, trendy cities, and beachside lifestyle. As of now, Aussies do not offer an official Digital Nomad visa for remote employees. One outback-route into the country, though, is the Visitor Visa. This is for tourists who would like to live and work in Australia, but don’t sing to the sound of six months of farm work. This visa can be valid for up to one year, and costs an estimated £99 to apply for. 8. USAAs home of the tech capital, Silicon Valley, the United States should be a shoe-in for the Digital Nomad scheme. But the country is more used to exporting talent than importing it, and there is currently no visa available for remote workers to live out their American dream. The US is not the most welcoming. It’s a challenge to find a long-term work permit, as many of the programmes only cater to specific roles and degree-holders. Still, most remote workers will qualify to work in the country for up to six months with the B-1 Business Visa. 9. CanadaSnowy Canada is often included on lists of the ‘best countries for digital nomads’, so you might be surprised to see it featured here. But even though the so-called Great White North still doesn’t have an official Digital Nomad visa, it’s certainly speaking to them. Last year, Canada unveiled its Tech Talent Strategy, a new immigration initiative to allow temporary tech workers to work remotely in the country for up to six months. And the best part? During this time, employees only need visitor status, so you won’t even need to apply. 10. VietnamAbundant natural wonders, unique cuisine, and tens of historic towns and cities has made Vietnam one of the best-known tourist destinations. It’s also increasingly called home by thousands of remote workers across the globe, despite not having any Digital Nomad visa. Many pass through Vietnam on their way to other destinations in southeast Asia, such as Bali and Thailand, which is why they apply for the Business Visa. It permits holders to work for a total of 90 days, and is valid for up to one year with unlimited entry into Vietnam. 11. New ZealandYou can’t get much further away from the UK than New Zealand; the home of Hobbiton and Russell Crowe is the ideal destination for those who love travelling. And, while it doesn’t yet have a Digital Nomad visa, there are signs it could plan to announce one soon. New Zealand’s ruling party, the National Party, has begun outlining early plans to introduce a one-year long visa scheme, admitting 250 applicants to begin with. No official launch date for the scheme has yet been announced. In the meantime, Brits should content themselves with New Zealand’s Working Holiday Visa. The scheme allows visa holders from the UK to live and work in NZ for three years. Learn about the potential New Zealand Digital Nomad visa and what we know so far.   \n",

Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer unveiled the new pledges as part of the Labour Party’s official manifesto, titled Change, in Greater Manchester earlier today. Similar to gender pay gap reporting, the legislation would make it mandatory for firms to report on the pay disparity between Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) staff in a workforce. Racial Inequality ActThe principle that all workers, regardless of gender, race, sexuality, or disability, are entitled to equal pay for equal work was first set out in the Equal Pay Act. However, the existing legislation does not currently require businesses to divulge the difference in pay for ethnicity. That could soon change if the Labour Party, which is currently winning in UK polls, comes into power. In his speech, Starmer confirmed plans to introduce a new Racial Inequality Act. According to Labour’s manifesto, this would “enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people. ”Similar to the Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information), the new laws would require some firms to publish specific ethnicity payroll data to reveal any wage disparities. Exact details on how the reporting process would work have not yet been revealed. Based on the current rules for gender pay gap reporting, only organisations with more than 250 employees (classed as large businesses in the UK) would need to publish the data. When comparing average hourly pay for minority ethnic versus white employees, data from the Office for National Statistics shows a mean pay gap of 25. 8% . Disability pay gapAs well as asking large businesses to report on the difference in pay between ethnic minority employees, Labour has also vowed to support more disabled employees in the UK, by requiring companies to publish data on the Disability Pay Gap. Disabled employees are often unable to work full-time, or are forced to go on long-term sickness absence, due to their disability, resulting in lower average wages overall. They also might face barriers and discrimination in employment. In November 2023, TUC analysis of data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) found that the difference in average earnings between disabled and non-disabled workers is now 14. 6% . This is 5. 5% greater than the gender pay gap between men and women. Starmer also said the party would seek to make disability hate crime an “aggravated offence” and “tackle the Access to Work backlog”. DWP figures show that the number of disabled people waiting for a decision on their Access to Work claim reached 25, 063 by December 2023. Awareness grows of UK pay inequalityLabour has not signalled if it would extend the pledge to cover sexual orientation. On average, LGBTQ+ workers in the UK earn £6, 700 less than their straight counterparts, contributing to a LGBTQ+ Pay Gap. Similarly, it has given no word on the Class Pay Gap, which refers to the difference in pay among workers from different social backgrounds, and few UK employers report on. Still, the decision to introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap data has been welcomed by experts. Melissa Blissett, Pay Gap Analytics Lead at Barnett Waddingham, said it sent “a clear message of fair pay, fair progression, and reward for the workplace. ”However, Blissett also cautioned that “lessons also need to be learnt from gender pay gap reporting”, opining that “reporting itself is not enough to change the dial. ”“Going beyond the reporting figures and analysing the underlying data to monitor trends, progress, potential blockers and drivers of the pay gap will be important, ” she added.   \n",

But new data suggests that the upper limits of creativity are being curbed by the government, as profanity-loving business owners come up against the censorship of Companies House. In total, 766 business names were rejected in 2023, with swearing being the main offence. According to a Freedom of Information request, submitted by 1st Formations, curse words made up 24% of business name applications rejected by Companies House last year. Companies House has strict rules about what is and is not allowed in a firm’s title. But experts are now cautioning that the government’s laws on registering a trademark or name might be behind the times with Brits’ love of a good swear word. ‘Doofus’ too rude to be registered as a company nameEntrepreneurs might be curious about just how profanity-laden their business name idea needs to be for Companies House to turn it down. As the 1st Formations findings suggest, even a mildly offensive term might be enough to earn entrepreneurs a rejection letter. Blasphemous business names rejected by Companies House in 2023 include:Little Pricks Tattoo StudioWtf Where’s The FoodPhat Phuc Noodle Bar LtdSee You Next Tuesday LtdForkin Recruitment LtdFukin Takeaway LtdFukim LtdFart LimitedCfuk LimitedInsults that wouldn’t be out of place on a primary school playground can be turned down by Companies House. Just ask the owner of ‘Doofus Dream Cars Limited’ and ‘Lmao Ltd’, both of which were rejected as expletives. Of the 188 business names rejected for swearing, ‘crap’ was also a common occurrence within the list, with names like ‘Crappy Nappy’ and ‘Scrap Your Crap Ltd’ both turned down. This is despite the eco-friendly toilet paper brand, ‘Who Gives A Crap? ’, which is based in Australia, announcing it achieved record UK sales this week, suggesting that Aussie attitudes to swearing are more relaxed than the British government. Companies House needs bringing “up to date”Earlier this year, data compiled by US recommendation service Enjoy Movies Your Way found that the annual number of swear words across mainstream TV shows and films in Western media has surged from fewer than 5, 000 in 1985, to over 60, 000 last year. Linguists today argue that swear words are becoming more acceptable in the UK, and are today used merely to emphasise points rather than cause offence. This language transformation could be why Companies House’s strict policies on supposedly rude names now feel out of touch with modern society. 1st Formations’ Director, Nicholas Campion, argues the list shows the government has an “outdated assessment process. ”“Companies House [may] need to bring itself up to date with modern language usage, as the Oxford English Dictionary has done, and, while we’re at it, accommodate the Great British sense of humour, ” he adds. There could be a real business incentive to adopting a punny business name. Last year, a consumer survey by BusinessNameGenerator showed that 64% of Brits would be more likely to notice and remember a funny company name, which could lead to a boost in sales. How to choose a business nameProfanity was not the only reason for business names being rejected in 2023. The 1st Formations data sorts the list into six prohibited categories:Profanity – 24% Drug references – 16% Sexual content – 15% Violence – 11% Discrimination – 8% Uncategorised – 26% Here are some examples of the kind of organisation names that are forbidden by Companies House for the above reasons:Rejected business nameReason for rejectionHorny Brew LtdSexual contentThe Prince Albert LtdSexual contentJerk Off Chicken LimitedSexual contentDank Productions LtdDrug referencesColin Bakes Dope (Responsibly) Ltd’Drug referencesW H Spliff LtdDrug referencesRagnarok Knives LtdViolencePsycho Traders LtdViolenceKiller Instinct LtdViolenceAryan Boss LtdDiscriminationKKK Properties LtdDiscriminationThere are also a number of other reasons why a company name may be rejected by Companies House, such as excluding “Limited”, “Ltd”, “Cyfyngedig”, “Cyf” or if the name lacks uniqueness or is too similar to another company. For example, W H Spliff would likely be considered objectionable even without the drugs reference, thanks to its similarity to the name of a certain, well-known UK retail chain.

Revolut has made the investment despite being a remote-first brand, signalling some form of return to office (RTO) might be on the cards. The Revolut team will move into the larger, newly-refurbished building in March 2025. The startup began in the business district back in 2015, four years before it won the 2019 Startups 100. The relocation follows the announcement of an employee share sale in May, and suggests Revolut is betting on the new office space to facilitate further growth and investment. The company recently confirmed plans to expand its global workforce by 40% in 2024. “More innovative” office spaceThe popularity of remote and hybrid working has created a number of challenges within the commercial property sector. Many businesses have downsized their office space, choosing to reduce rental costs rather than invest in an under-utilised work environment. Revolut’s latest uproot will do the opposite. The new headquarters will take up 113k sq ft of desk space in the building, over four floors, to expand the company’s overall office footprint in London by 40% . Despite the change, Revolut continues to describe itself as a remote-first company. Over a third of its workforce is based outside of the capital, and the brand has a “permanent flexible working” policy that allows workers to choose if and when to come into the office. However, the new lease suggests that office attendance and in-person engagement is a priority for the business. According to a press release, Revolut will use the swanky space in “a more innovative way” for product launches, workshops, team-building activities, and other events. Recruit to the office? Revolut’s decision to invest in office space also forms part of its supercharged recruitment strategy. The fintech firm has previously shared plans to boost its global workforce by 40% in 2024, expanding from 8, 000 staff members in January, to 11, 500 by the end of the year. Job seekers could be swayed by the many amenities and employee benefits afforded by the new building. Alongside desk space, YY London also has showers, cycle parks, two restaurants, a cafe, and outdoor terrace space. Experts have argued that businesses need to invest in flexible office space in order to attract new hires and engage staff members. Other banking brands have taken a different outlook, however. Last year, HSBC made headlines when it declared it would move out of its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower, and into a smaller, more flexible headquarter building based in the City of London. Earlier this week, Lloyds Banking Group Plc also confirmed it would move thousands of staffers to the City, in order to create a “more sustainable office footprint”. Employers split on RTOSome employers have clashed with their remote workforce this year, as the debate around home working rages. Manchester United and Dell Technologies have both made recent headlines for rolling out RTO policies that punished team members for choosing to work from home. Revolut appears to be taking a more empathetic approach to the debate. Rather than penalise staff for working from home, the investment in the YY London building suggests the brand thinks rewards, incentives and a new environment will improve office attendance. It remains to be seen if Revolut’s planned events and workshops will prove exciting enough to keep hybrid teams returning to the office, and encourage new team members to join them.

       "233     Budding female entrepreneur? Looking for funding to get your idea off the ground? Then you may want to consider applying for a Start Up Loan. According to new data published today, The Start Up Loans company has provided over £100m in funding to some 17, 000 women in business since its launch in 2012. In London alone, over 5, 0000 female start-up founders have received £30m in loans through the initiative, followed by female business owners in the South East and South West who have secured £10m each over the last five years. The government-backed loans scheme reports that 39% of its funding goes to women in business making up over 17, 000 of the 44, 000 loans it has provided in total. Female entrepreneurs that have received a loan through the scheme include Ruth Davis, founder of bespoke London florist boutique All for Love, and Pip Murray, founder of 2016 Startups Awards-winning nut butter company Pip & Nut. First formed by the department for business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS, formerly BIS), The Start Up Loans Company provides loans up to £25, 000 at 6% fixed rate per annum and offers a mentoring service to each business it supports. Ruth Davis commented: “Launching my very own florist had long been a dream of mine, but access to funding was a barrier to making it a reality in the first instance. Our funding from the Start Up Loans Company was used to subsidise our initial set-up costs so All for Love could get going and confidently enter the marketplace. “I’d encourage anyone thinking of starting their own business to explore the options available to them. There are funding sources and support which can make launching your business a smoother journey from the outset. ”Apply for a Start Up Loan here. \n",
