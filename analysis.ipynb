       "      <td>The legal infrastructure surrounding Human Resources (HR) is one of the most important aspects, yet many entrepreneurs overlook this in the heat of starting up a business.    When startups endeavour to be at the forefront of the innovation game, the complicated fact of dealing with workforce diversity becomes an important subject to address. The different legal complexities which successful startups must take care of not only allow the liberty to innovate but also to develop a compliant culture which produces the perfect conditions for business development. In the highly dynamic startup market, where speed and a sense of initiative are key, lawyers' involvement in the HR domain is never only a 'must' but also inevitably strategic. As the workforce of the startup is expanding, the scope of legal matters it faces is increasing too. Starting from drafting policies about attracting the talent to fashioning contracts to ensure fair pay and moving through the complexities of wage and hour issues in the workplace – this is tricky and requires a lot of  diligence. Although startups indeed rely on their many innovations to succeed in a competitive market, knowing the legal fundamentals of HR helps companies to protect the workers’ rights and enforce compliance.  Let’s dive into some important aspects to take onboard the legal side of HR, and what startups should know:  RECRUITMENT AND HIRING Despite the gnarly landscape of recruitment and hiring, startups have a peculiar set of challenges which need a combination of creativity and legal acumen. It goes beyond creating job descriptions. This is about crafting job descriptions which are not only non-discriminatory but also resonate with the startup’s brand message of diversity and inclusivity. The process is rather close to complex terrain where startups have to identify the best talent and interplay their strategies with legal regulations. Background checks play an important role concerning candidate suitability and a way needs to be found to carry them out which does not interfere with privacy laws yet also does not induce biases. This analysis of legal complications in attracting and recruiting talent is never a mere procedure, it is a manifestation of justice, equal opportunity, and the rule of law. This is a lighthouse which startups use to map a recruitment path to meet the need for growth, as well as consciously ethically legally to build a workplace which adheres to merit, diversity and regulatory compliances EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS Clarity and comprehensiveness in employment contracts are the stepping stones to a healthy employer-employee relationship. This document acts as a guide which enlists the terms and conditions associated with working in an organisation. In the complicated web of these agreements, the job responsibilities play an important role, they bring about clarity and mutual understanding.  This part of the document expresses the tasks the employee will be responsible for as well as mentions projects and performance evaluation. Simultaneously, the compensation system becomes a part of the fabric of the relationship, linking up the financial components. Employee remunerations involve base salaries, bonuses, and other benefits which should be well-defined and under employment regulations.  Confidentiality clauses sets down what shall be considered confidential data, the period of confidentiality obligations, and liabilities for breaches. Non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, which may be applicable, add extra layers of protection, on the one hand, creating a delicate balance between the avoidance of the company's interests and the respect for employees' professional mobility, on the other hand. Concluding clauses, with their subtle provisions, regulate the termination of the employment relationship, too, by providing benefits, perks, pensions, health care, notice periods, severance terms and reasons for the termination as well. The provision of a dispute resolution mechanism built into these contracts provides a structured approach to the resolution of conflicts that enhances efficiency and decreases the number of legal issues. At the end of the day, these contracts are more than a legal document, rather, they serve as an indispensable tool in the symbiotic and healthy partnership between startups and their workers. WORKPLACE POLICIES Robust policies are necessary for startups aspiring to build cultures which are positive and compliant, establishing anti-discrimination policies, codes of conduct, and other essential policies all startups should have. Workplace policies in startups serve as a key pillar of the business, forming the culture and moulding compliance. These  guidelines are a compass for employees to deal with professional behaviour and expectations. Showcasing the company's commitment to anti-bias against race, gender, age or any protected categories, startups produce an inclusive environment which stimulates creativity. The code of ethics establishes the norm for ethical behaviour and outlines what is acceptable or not equally important. They are the north star, playing the role of a guide in ensuring the employees make decisions which are in line with the company's values and contribute to the formation of a positive workplace culture. With the increasing use of remote job opportunities and digital communication, it is key for startups to develop sophisticated policies on the use of technology and data protection, making sure delicate information is never misused. These policies, when merged, form a cultural foundation which serves the interests of the startup and also provides a workplace where everyone feels honoured, respected, and of value to the collective success of the venture. WAGE AND HOUR COMPLIANCE Compliance with wage and hour laws is a tricky issue, especially for young companies with limited financial outlays. Overtime, minimum wage and other wage-related legalities: startups need to understand how they will pay their workers by the law. The area of compliance concerning wages and hours in startup management is one of the most challenging aspects, mainly for startups with limited resources. In addition to these foundational parts, wage-related legalities cover meal, and rest periods as well as adding more items to compliance, making the job tough. This intricate level requires a multi-plan strategy where the startups must be in a position to quickly react to the evolving labour laws. This vigilance makes sure there is a continuity between legal frameworks and fair compensation practices that create a regulatory compliant corporate culture which is based on fairness and respect. All in all, having this avenue prevents legal liabilities and also develops a rhythm of the workplace, which is appealing to employees, and later the  foundation for the sustainability of the startup. TERMINATION AND LEGAL RISKS While nobody likes to contemplate it, understanding the legal implications of dismissal is necessary. A manual including proper procedures which minimise the legal risks which come from employee termination has to be part of a startup’s operation. Handling the delicate issue of employee termination is a vital but often an embarrassing point in running a successful startup company. Termination is never about only checking the box, but the essential exercise undertaken to guard the interests of both the organisation and the employees.  During this period, thinking about termination may not be tempting for a startup, but being cognisant of the legal implications is the key to minimising the risks of termination. From making sure there are written termination clauses in employment contracts to paying attention to the notice periods and severance terms, startups need to go through this process with exactness. It is a fine line between the company's interests and being fair to the employees who already left. It endows a startup with the much-needed legal knowledge and also reinforces the significance of creating a culture which encourages clear communication and healthy employee relations through the exit process which can be a nightmare. A startup must be proactive in acknowledging and legally addressing termination complexities to build a foundation of trust and compliance, which then serves as a platform for long-term growth. THE LEGAL ASPECT OF HR MAY BE A CHALLENGE, HOWEVER, IT’S ALSO A CHANCE STARTUP SHOULD NEVER MISS Knowing and taking good care of the legal aspects, startups build a strong foundation for long-term growth and success. It is in the dynamic world of startups, where innovation and development is breathtaking, dealing with the complications of the law in the area of Human Resources is never only a challenge but a strategic gateway.  Along with the growth of startups into full-fledged businesses, there is a need for a sophisticated understanding of legalities in managing the workforce. This is a multi-step process which entails walking through the intricate maze of recruiting, employment contracts, workplace policies, wage and hour compliance, employee benefits, as well as delicate issues of termination. Nevertheless, the flipside of the coin holds the potential to give birth to a solid foundation that serves as a launchpad for continuous development. In a choreography of legal duties and organisational development, startups have the chance both to follow legal rules and to create a workplace environment which is positively received by the staff. This is a journey of turning difficulties into opportunities and building a company culture which survives and also thrives in the dynamic startup environment. Startups move through these regulatory loopholes by exerting due diligence and foresight. They never only manage the challenges; they emerge compliant as well as capable of long-lasting success.

       "      <td>On the 6th April, the work landscape in the UK will be undergoing a big change. The date marks the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill.   The legislation ensures that all employees have the legal right to request flexible working. This can include requests to change the number of hours they work, when they start or finish work, the days they work, and where they work. Once in force, workers are set to benefit from new protections:  New requirements for employers to consult with the employee before rejecting their flexible working request Permission to make two statutory requests in any 12-month period (rather than the current one request) Reduced waiting times for decisions to be made (within which an employer administers the statutory request) from three months to two months The removal of existing requirements that the employee must explain what effect, if any, the change applied for would have on the employer and how that effect might be dealt with  Following the announcement that the legislation had achieved Royal Assent, Business and Trade Minister Kevin Hollinrake said: “A happier workforce means increased productivity, and that’s why we’re backing measures to give people across the UK even more flexibility over where and when they work. “Not only does flexible working help individuals fit work alongside other commitments – whether it’s the school drop off, studying or caring for vulnerable friends and family – it’s good business sense too, helping firms to attract more talent, increase retention and improve workforce diversity.” How will this work? As of the 6th April, employees will be about to make a statutory application regarding flexible working. Currently, employees must have worked for the same employer for at least 26 weeks to be eligible, but from the 6th April, employees can request flexible working from their first day in a new job. Another change is that previously, employees were only able to make one request in the space of 12 month, but this has now been increased to two requests within the same period. Employers must deal with requests in a reasonable manner. Employers must assess the advantages and disadvantages of the application, hold a meeting to discuss the request with the employee, and offer an appeal process. If an employer doesn’t handle the request in a reasonable manner, the employee can take them to an employee tribunal over it. Though, if the request is handled reasonably, an employer is allowed to refuse an application if they have a good business reason for doing so. Applying for flexible working The basic steps of applying for flexible working are as follows:  The employee writes to the employer with their flexible working request. The application must include the date, a statement that this is a statutory request, details of how the employee wants to work flexibly and when they want to start, an explanation of how they think flexible working might affect the business and how this could be dealt with, and a statement saying if and when they’ve made a previous application. The employer must consider the request and make a decision within two months, or longer if agreed with the employee. If the employer agrees to the request, they must change the terms and conditions in the employee’s contract. If agreeing to the application, the employer should write to the employee with a statement of the agreed changes, and a start date for when this will take effect. All of this should be done as soon as possible, but no later than 28 days after the request was approved. If the employer disagrees, they must write to the employee giving the business reasons for the refusal. Employers may reject an application for different reasons, such as: extra costs that will damage the business, the work cannot be reorganised among other staff, people cannot be recruited to do the work, flexible working will affect quality and performance, the business will not be able to meet customer demand, there’s a lack of work to do during the proposed working times, the business is planning changes to the workforce. The employee may be able to complain to an employment tribunal if they believe the request has not been dealt with in a reasonable manner.  Reactions from the industry The workforce has responded positively to the announcement of this legislation. A study conducted by Slack which surveyed 1,000 UK desk workers found that over half (55%) of employees plan to apply for new flexible working arrangements following the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill. It is estimated that the largest demographic set to benefit from this change is working parents, who are more likely to request earlier working hours to align with school hours. Though some people don’t believe this bill is quite enough to make a real difference. Ronni Zehavi, CEO and Co-Founder of HiBob commented: “The Employee Relations (Flexible Working) Act, Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act and Carer’s Leave legislation represent important steps forward in the UK – however, they still fall short of the needs of modern employees. We all know that the workplace has fundamentally changed post-pandemic with the prevalence of hybrid work models. Businesses offering only the bare minimum to employees with vastly different expectations risk being left behind, as individuals have no qualms about seeking better opportunities elsewhere. They must actively address the unique needs of their workforce to remain competitive. “Take childcare as an example. The new support will enable thousands of parents – specifically women who take on a disproportionate share of unpaid caregiving – to re-enter the workforce. However, if they return to a workplace with a lack of flexibility, balancing personal and professional responsibilities will be a huge challenge, where in some cases, they are forced to make sacrifices. This in turn, causes inequality in the workplace, which has caused over five in 10 (53%) women to state that having children negatively impacted career progress.  “The point is legislation can only go so far. It is down to the employers to create cultures where everyone can thrive. Being able to request flexible work from day one is progress but doesn’t allow for the realistic needs of people. Companies need to put their employees first in order to retain top talent – creating real change and in turn, boosting business profits.” Molly Johnson-Jones, flexible working expert and co-founder and CEO of Flexa, stated: “Crucially, there's no guarantee that these requests for flexible work will be granted. Making employers consult employees about their application, as the secondary legislation (the Employment Relations Act 2023) which is also coming into effect, is unlikely to change this either. This could leave thousands of employees who rely on flexible work in precarious positions if their requests are turned down. Individuals should know whether their needs can be accommodated before they accept a role. “The new legislation risks exacerbating \"fake flexibility”, where companies claim to offer flexible working on job adverts, but are under no obligation to offer it in practice. This makes it nearly impossible for job seekers to determine which employers will genuinely accommodate their requests for flexible work. Job seekers deserve more than legislation that risks further muddying the waters around flexible work entitlements. “What employees really need and deserve is clarity from employers about the level of flexibility they can offer, whether that’s fully remote work, hybrid work or 5 days in an office. This is the only way for job seekers to identify companies that can accommodate their working preferences. It's also the best way for employers to find staff who will genuinely thrive in the working environment they offer.” Though, the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill on the 6th April is a great first step in ensuring a more fair playing field for those who may not be able to work the traditional 9-5 hours due to parenthood and care responsibilities.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Businesses are making positive strides towards overcoming the historical lack of diversity within the tech workforce, as data suggests that more than half (52%) set diversity targets (up from 46% last year).   The Diversity in Tech 2023 report from emerging talent and reskill training provider, Wiley Edge, found that many businesses are seeking to rewrite tech’s historically poor reputation for diversity, with considerable success. Wiley Edge’s research, which included surveying 300 respondents in senior IT leadership roles within medium to large enterprises, highlighted that businesses are increasingly embracing anti-bias hiring strategies. This is proving to impact workforce diversity positively in turn. Setting diversity targets was the most widely used strategy of businesses surveyed. But the report also suggests that anti-bias training for interviewers (used by 43% of businesses) and blind CV reviews (used by 31%) are on the rise - up from 41% and 25% respectively last year. However, the same proportion of businesses publish neutral job descriptions as last year (44%), while only 25% of businesses prioritise diverse shortlists, down from 37% last year.  Those taking proactive steps are reaping the benefits and setting a positive example for other businesses grappling with workforce diversity challenges. Wiley Edge’s research found that a significant 96% of businesses using a strategy have noticed a positive impact on their workforce diversity. Importantly, this is being recognised by employees, with just 6% of Gen Z tech workers surveyed feeling that diversity was not a priority to their employer during their own recruitment journey. Khadijah Pandor, Head of Partnerships, EMEA &amp; NA, at Wiley Edge, commented: “It’s encouraging to see the beginnings of a success story start to emerge, as employers of tech talent take action and introduce strategies to help improve workforce diversity. The positive outcomes that many employers are seeing only reinstates the value of this type of work, setting a positive example for other industries facing challenges to follow suit. “However, there is still more to be done to encourage talent from diverse backgrounds to consider and feel equipped to pursue a career in tech. Through our work with clients in high-demand sectors from banking to insurance, we’ve seen a real commitment to helping rewrite the code of diversity in tech. But, understandably, it can be difficult for busy employers to know where to start.  “This is why we actively support forward-thinking employers to diversify talent pipelines and help graduates from diverse backgrounds get ready to thrive in the world of work. This includes training graduates from many different universities and supporting a diverse Alumni population of talent - 42% of which are women, and 51% are Black, Asian, or minority ethnic.” A range of different anti-bias hiring strategies were deployed by the businesses surveyed. These included:  Setting diversity targets – identifying areas for improvement, such as increasing the number of women in leadership positions or the proportion of employees from low socio-economic backgrounds Publishing neutral job descriptions – using gender-neutral language and avoiding stereotypically gendered terms in the advertisement of all positions  Conducting blind CV reviews – removing any indicators of the candidate’s identity, such as gender, age, and ethnicity, to focus entirely on their skills and experience Providing anti-bias training for interviewers – supporting those involved in recruitment to recognise any biases and concentrate solely on factors which affect the candidate’s ability to deliver in post Prioritising diverse shortlists – ensuring that candidates selected for the final stages are from a diverse range of backgrounds</td>\n",

       "      <td>Take the time to do some research, and you can quickly find the names of 50 leading UK-based black tech entrepreneurs, all highly respected and the powerhouses behind successful businesses.   No doubt, they all make significant contributions to the £25 billion generated into the UK economy every year by small entrepreneur business owners from ethnic minority backgrounds. However, those figures could be even more impressive if the Black community could increase its presence in the tech sector. Sadly, it is a fact of life that those from ethnic minority backgrounds face challenges that other entrepreneurs do not encounter, such as disproportionately greater difficulty in accessing finance and a lack of mainstream support. That is why Ashleigh Ainsley, one of the Top 50 black tech entrepreneurs and co-founder of London-based Colorintech, has become a driving force in the movement to increase the number of ethnic minorities entering the UK tech workforce. His overriding passion has driven a professional mission for him to make London the most inclusive tech hub in the world. \"By building programs that create access to some of the world's most innovative companies for ethnic minorities, we believe we can create a more inclusive tech industry that will ultimately result in wealth creation and close opportunity gaps. It is vital that we continue to work with corporate partners to co-develop leadership and development programs for their workforce to drive inclusion as part of that process,\" said Ainsley. He added, \"Increasing Black representation in the tech sector will have benefits beyond wages. It will improve the lives of those who are marginalized and undervalued in the workplace. But beyond that, we are at the precipice of the next industrial revolution, and it would be a huge oversight if we systematically ignored the contributions diverse professionals have to make in shaping that future.\" Alarmingly, while the data is scarce, Black people are estimated to make up just three percent of the UK tech workforce, despite the majority of tech roles being in London, where they make up 14% of the population. Data suggests that the problem is not the qualification or merit of applicants but rather a lack of opportunity, a dearth of contacts, and often an unwillingness from those in positions of power to deliver meaningful initiatives to improve workforce diversity. \"Underlying issues, such as discrimination, are deep-rooted and will take time and effort to change. But there are many who believe that the time for excuses justifying the lack of Black representation in the UK tech ecosystem is over,\" said Mr. Ainsley. \"Our own Barriers research suggests that 60 percent of Black professionals have experienced significant obstacles and barriers to entering the sector.\" Ainsley added, \"In today's multicultural society, there is simply no reason why ethnic minorities should still face discrimination and microaggressions in the workplace.\" Since Colorintech's inception five years ago, it has helped a community of 30,000 and seen 5,000 tech professionals through its programs. Black tech talent does exist, but if the UK is going to truly thrive in an increasingly competitive global economy, it cannot ignore the inequity exacerbating skill shortages in the sector that result from excluding black professionals. \"It is more than just a question of race and diversity. If companies are to grow and prosper, then Black representation in the tech sector must be given the opportunity to thrive and develop,\" said Mr. Ainsley. \"Our mission is to empower and inspire, to show the world that Black excellence in entrepreneurship and professional careers is not just a pipe dream or confined to a few 'success stories.' Given the opportunity, Black Tech Talent will become an even more significant contributor to the UK tech landscape.”</td>\n",

Why should startups invest early in diverse people, and how they can do this to make a greater social impact whilst also improving business?    Recent Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements helped shed light on the challenges women and ethnic minorities continue to face seeking equity in society today. These powerful social and political movements undoubtedly had an impact on peoples’ thinking – and impacted how businesses lead and support their own micro-communities too. We are seeing a promising move towards allyship and more inclusive hiring practices in business, diverse teams and boards, and more career support for those from under-represented groups. While there is still more work to be done, the benefits of early-stage businesses championing a more diverse and inclusive working environment are undeniable. Talent poor, to talent powered Brexit, global supply chain problems and COVID-19 proved the perfect storm for British businesses, further exacerbating the skills problems across almost every industry. According to research by Skillsoft, around three-quarters of IT decision-makers worldwide claim to be facing critical skills gaps across tech departments. Talent is in short supply and organisations are having to fight for limited resources.  When it comes to startup hiring, every action and every decision is critical – in a small team one employee has the potential to drive significant growth in the company. While startups may be attractive to jobseekers because of their high-growth potential, earning opportunities and agile nature – these are not always the most important aspects employees are looking for. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&amp;) is now a significant factor for job seekers in the market today. According to a Glassdoor survey, 72% of women, 89% of black respondents, 80% of Asians, and 70% of Latinos, said workforce diversity was important to them. This was a sentiment echoed by a significant majority of white respondents, who also said workforce diversity was important when selecting their next role.  Diverse and inclusive businesses are opening themselves up to a much larger talent pool than the companies who continue to recruit in the same way they have for 30 years. Startups have a genuine opportunity to not only entice great diverse teams by committing to an inclusive talent attraction strategy in the early-stages of their businesses, but to grow and nurture a truly inclusive working culture too. Employees from every group need to feel psychologically safe to bring their unique perspectives forward and the lessons learned here, will enable startups to scale sustainably and ethically.  Engines of innovation At its core, a startup is a problem-solving entity seeking answers to multiple questions. Its ideas come from people, and teams of people working together. If a startup were to nring together a group of innovators that share the same life experiences and dimensions to build a new product or solution – they are eradicating diversity of thought and unlikely to produce something that is unique, relevant and accessible to all factions of society today. The more diverse teams are across gender, ethnicity, age, educational background, experience level and expertise - the more likely your creative team will draw inspiration from seemingly unrelated places.   When it comes to deciding which ideas to test and put more resources behind, diverse teams are also far better than homogenous ones. With more pathways to execute on an idea, you will see diverse teams move forward with - or ditch - ideas far faster and more cost-effectively.  On average, startups take three to four years to be profitable, but 2019 analysis from Mckinsey &amp; Company found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. In the case of ethnic and cultural diversity, the business-case findings were equally compelling: top-quartile companies outperformed those in the fourth by 36 percent in profitability.  How to make ED&amp;I a priority How do startups and larger, more advanced organisations integrate ED&amp;I into their business strategies to reap the rewards of more diverse teams? The first step is to make your founders and business leaders aware of the benefits of being an inclusive business and to acknowledge the need for change.   Audit: Look at your existing talent attraction and retention practices, and assess current strengths and opportunities to gauge what is working, and what isn’t. Have you created an inclusive culture? Does your leadership reflect that? Plan: If your organisation does not have the infrastructure in place to make immediate improvements to your diversity strategy, allocate resources to develop permanent training programs and policies. The makeup of your senior leadership team, top management, your customers, and key stakeholders are all huge signifiers to the rest of your workforce. Sustain: Make accountability a priority. For example, make all hiring managers must all share in the vital objective to provide equal opportunities access to roles, if this is the wider business goal.  Go public: Just as annual business objectives may be shared within an organisation to encourage all teams to work towards the same goal – diversity and inclusion goals should also be made public. If you meet these benchmarks, share the successes with your employees and be transparent about any setbacks - just keep moving forward.  The survival of a startup relies on its profitability, growth, agility and innovation – all areas where people are critical in contributing to success. The renewed focus on employers to prioritise diversity and ensure people of different genders, ethnicities and backgrounds are given equal opportunity to contribute, is important for every social impact business. However, diversity and inclusion is also integral to business success. Understanding this relationship is what will help businesses – of every shape and size – to truly build a corporate culture that supports and values different perspectives.</td>\n",

Minority Groups At Risk Of Online Harm Young people from minority groups – such as those from Black, Asian, minority ethnic backgrounds, and LGBTQI+ youth – are more likely to be exposed to and experience online harms than their white, heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, according to new research from the University of Surrey. While the research found that most young people do not regularly or directly experience online harm, a ‘substantial’ percentage of young people are exposed to harmful materials or content when logged on. Dr Emily Setty, co-author of the study and Lecturer in Criminology at the University of Surrey, said: “Our research makes clear that we must work with young people – particularly those from minority backgrounds – to identify and develop solutions that effectively prevent online harms. “A one-size-fits-all approach to minimising harm can’t hope to tackle the discrimination that seems to be hard-wired into young people’s online experiences. While young people were familiar with technical solutions to combat these risks, such as blocking and reporting accounts, our research highlighted that digital safety education is needed to help them develop critical understanding around these issues.” Sexist, Racist, Homophobic &amp; Transphobic Content According to the research, a substantial number of young people have encountered or experienced online harms and exposure to sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic content. Furthermore, the research highlighted that young women are at a heightened risk of being targeted with unwanted sexual content and often experience negative impacts – such as dissatisfaction with their bodies – associated with this behaviour. As part of a series of focus groups, participants aged 12 to 16 were shown a display of words relating to risks and harms online and were asked for their reactions. They discussed how different issues they experienced played out online, the actions they took to deal with them, and their views on digital safety education. Additionally, they discussed the benefits of being online and how they balanced risks and opportunities. Amidst the ongoing debate about the age restriction of social media channels and how Big Tech companies make them safer, the research team at Surrey also found that young people who use social media apps at a higher rate are more at risk than young people who spend their time on activities such as gaming or streaming. Emma Robertson, Co-Founder of online safety organisation Digital Awareness UK, said: “This research resonates with the conversations our organisation is having with young people about topics such as online hate speech, which they are experiencing at alarming rates. Much awareness and progress has come about as a result of big social movements which have played out online, such as racism in football or sexual harassment, as seen with Everyone’s Invited. “However, at a time when discussions about topics such as race, identity and sexuality are being debated and spotlighted online, we must remember that young people are also experiencing unprecedented amounts of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia online. This only highlights the pressing need for educators, parents and carers to get the support they require to help young people manage these challenges, and for policymakers and tech companies to help make online spaces as inclusive and safe as possible.”</td>\n",

This isn’t the only place where an AI bias can happen though: it can also be when an AI algorithm is used outside of the content it was initially created for. For example, a product that is specifically built for farmers wouldn’t have factory workers or business executives represented. This isn’t AI bias, but design bias. Tip #2: Have a diverse team Left unchecked, human biases can find their way into datasets, corrupting the decision making process that the system uses to generate solutions. Having a team that is diverse brings diverse thoughts and opinions, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ages, etc. will not only challenge ideas, but can catch biases before they’re implemented into your AI system. Having a diverse team truly makes the difference when striving for a stronger Ethical AI framework, especially when ensuring the avoidance of Simpson Paradoxes. Tip #3: Use bias bounties One way to detect biases and discrimination in AI is to use bias bounties to catch bad data, avoiding further deviation of the analytics. Bias bounties are implemented to reward users for identifying bias in AI systems. These biases happen as a result of incomplete data or existing bad data that can lead to an AI that is unethical. Several major companies are using bias bounties in 2022 as a way to ensure their AI systems are as ethical and robust as possible. It’s an easy and relatively inexpensive way to get more diverse thought processes to look at and review your AI. Tip #4: Cultivate responsible AI at every level of your company Having responsible AI at all levels within an organisation is a necessity, especially now in 2022. Before, organisations could get by with just having it in their technical R&amp;D or research teams involved, who would then communicate downward to their customers and partners. With the ever changing landscape of responsible AI use, this is an area where no compromises can be made.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Research by Connectr, the leading HR tech platform for building businesses where people belong, has revealed the five groups hardest hit by the pandemic. Underrepresented Talent (19 out of 20*) During times of social and economic uncertainty, it is often those from lower socio-economic backgrounds that are the worst affected. During the pandemic, these groups are less likely to have had access to support networks and technology, making working virtually incredibly difficult. This is hindering career progression, building on pre-existing workplace injustices. For example, in the Financial Services sector, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds take on average 25% longer to develop in their careers. This figure increases to 32% amongst people from lower socio-economic backgrounds who identify as black. Hospitality Industry (18 out of 20) Throughout much of 2020 and 2021, the industry was forced to place thousands of people on furlough due to COVID-19 restrictions effectively bringing the whole sector to a halt. Even now that businesses have been able to reopen, many of these workers have decided not to return, finding new industries to work in. This has created a new challenge, leaving hospitality bosses with a significant employee shortage.

What Will This Mean For Posts? University Students (17 out of 20) With many businesses pausing recruitment during the height of the pandemic, and so many internships and placements being cut, opportunities for graduates simply weren’t there. In addition, ‘on campus’ events moved online. This has been better than nothing, but the virtual environment often fails to give students the same results and networking opportunities as in-person interactions, putting them at a disadvantage compared to previous cohorts when attempting to enter the workplace. School students (14 out of 20) Young people have missed out on vital classroom experiences during the pandemic. Interacting with and learning from peers, face to face teaching and developing softer skills are all crucial to future success. For many, home learning was not possible due to lack of tech, space, or broadband capabilities. There were also fewer opportunities for work experience, which can be critical in introducing young people to career options available to them and equipping them with the knowledge and confidence they need to pursue a specific path. According to the ISE’s Recruitment Survey, released in November 2021, the number of internships and placement years offered did rise between 2019/20 and 2020/21, by 77% and 63% respectively, but are still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. New Starters (8 out of 20) Onboarding during the pandemic and numerous lockdowns has been tough, stopping people building important in-person relationships with colleagues. As with any new role, ‘learning by osmosis’ is crucial to progression, belonging and long-term successes. This isn’t happening for millions of new starters who are joining the workforce from home. This will likely have a detrimental effect on the speed at which they can progress. Will Akerman, Founder and MD of Connectr, concludes: “At Connectr, we specialise in understanding and nurturing underrepresented talent, and this gives us a unique insight into how the pandemic has impacted certain groups. The past two years have been tough for all of us, but for these five groups it has been even harder than anyone could have imagined. A lack of jobs, opportunities and support has left people feeling a sense of uncertainty, with many unsure where to turn to revive or kick start their careers. This simply isn’t fair and Connectr will continue to work with both the Government and UK businesses to support the most disadvantaged groups, ensuring nobody is left behind in the nation’s post-pandemic recovery.” *METHODOLOGY To determine the list of the top five biggest losers of lockdown, the experts at Connectr looked at all key groups effected by the pandemic and assigned them a score out of 10 for both the financial and the emotional impact caused by COVID-19. The financial impact score was based on factors including salary lost, employment opportunities missed, and time wasted. The emotional impact included measures such as increased stress, discrimination, and additional time pressures. This gave each group a score out of 20, 20 being the most impacted and 0 being the least impacted. Underrepresented talent was found to be the worst affected, scoring 9/10 for financial impact and 10/10 for emotional impact, an overall score of 19/20. The other four groups in the list were included as they all scored 8/20 or more, making them amongst the worst effected in the country.

       "      <td>The UK data watchdog has warned that neurotech has a “real danger” of bias and discrimination if proper precautions are not made. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said today that developments in neurotech – technology that interfaces with the brain or nervous system – could lead to discrimination against people if they are not “put at the heart of their development”. The regulator said that technology that monitors neurodata will become widespread in the next decade. One such company is Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing brain implants that it hopes to one day commercialise. Neurotech is currently most commonly used in the healthcare sector to predict, diagnose and treat complex conditions. The ICO, however, has said the tech will likely expand beyond the tightly regulated medical industry and be deployed across personal wellbeing, sports, marketing and other consumer industries. The regulator said that without proper testing on a wide range of subjects, and various groups – notably neurodivergent people – there will be a risk of discrimination. “To many, the idea of neurotechnology conjures up images of science fiction films, but this technology is real, and it is developing rapidly,” said Stephen Almond, executive director of regulatory risk. “Neurotechnology collects intimate personal information that people are often not aware of, including emotions and complex behaviour. The consequences could be dire if these technologies are developed or deployed inappropriately. “We want to see everyone in society benefit from this technology. It’s important for organisations to act now to avoid the real danger of discrimination.” The watchdog warned that future uses of neurotech will lead to unfair treatment without diverse data training. The ICO is currently developing neurodata guidance that will consider the “interpretation of core legislative and technical neurotechnology definitions”.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A former Uber Eats courier has brought legal action against the food delivery company, alleging he was unfairly dismissed because of the company’s “racist” facial recognition software. Uber Eats drivers are required to take a selfie before starting a shift to verify their identity. However, Pa Edrissa Manjang said that the Uber Eats app told him to take multiple selfies a day because the software incorrectly thought he was someone else. “Your algorithm, by the looks of things, is racist,” said Manjang, who is Black. On Wednesday an employment tribunal rejected Uber’s motion to dismiss the discrimination claim, which means the case will move to a full hearing. An Uber spokesperson told UKTN that “automated facial verification was not the reason for Mr Manjang’s temporary loss of access to his courier account”. The spokesperson added that Uber Eats’ Real-Time ID Check is used for safety and security purposes. “The system includes robust human review to make sure that we’re not making decisions about someone’s livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight,” the spokesperson said. Manjang told the Guardian that Uber doesn’t “value” or “respect” its delivery drivers and that it acts in an “aggressive manner”. “So, as a result, for the people that work for them, we are just numbers,” said Manjang. AI bias It’s not the first time that Uber has faced accusations that its facial recognition software is racially biased. In October last year, Abiodun Ogunyemi filed an employment tribunal case after Uber’s automated face-scanning software failed to recognise him, leading to his dismissal. AI experts say that facial recognition systems generally are not as accurate at identifying people from ethnic minority backgrounds. They say that this is often because the data used to train the algorithm tends to skew towards white men, which makes the software more accurate at identifying people from that demographic compared to others. Uber is not the only company facing legal issues over the use of facial recognition technology. Yesterday, Big Brother Watch filed a complaint against Southern Co-op over the use of the tech in 35 of its stores. Clearview AI was fined £7.5m by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) earlier this year for illegally collecting billions of images. The ICO is currently investigating if AI has a racial bias. It comes at a time when the use of digital identification applications are gradually increasing across the country. Some cinemas have begun accepting digital IDs as a method of proving age.</td>\n",

       "3316   The legal infrastructure surrounding Human Resources (HR) is one of the most important aspects, yet many entrepreneurs overlook this in the heat of starting up a business.    When startups endeavour to be at the forefront of the innovation game, the complicated fact of dealing with workforce diversity becomes an important subject to address. The different legal complexities which successful startups must take care of not only allow the liberty to innovate but also to develop a compliant culture which produces the perfect conditions for business development. In the highly dynamic startup market, where speed and a sense of initiative are key, lawyers' involvement in the HR domain is never only a 'must' but also inevitably strategic. As the workforce of the startup is expanding, the scope of legal matters it faces is increasing too. Starting from drafting policies about attracting the talent to fashioning contracts to ensure fair pay and moving through the complexities of wage and hour issues in the workplace – this is tricky and requires a lot of  diligence. Although startups indeed rely on their many innovations to succeed in a competitive market, knowing the legal fundamentals of HR helps companies to protect the workers’ rights and enforce compliance.  Let’s dive into some important aspects to take onboard the legal side of HR, and what startups should know:  RECRUITMENT AND HIRING Despite the gnarly landscape of recruitment and hiring, startups have a peculiar set of challenges which need a combination of creativity and legal acumen. It goes beyond creating job descriptions. This is about crafting job descriptions which are not only non-discriminatory but also resonate with the startup’s brand message of diversity and inclusivity. The process is rather close to complex terrain where startups have to identify the best talent and interplay their strategies with legal regulations. Background checks play an important role concerning candidate suitability and a way needs to be found to carry them out which does not interfere with privacy laws yet also does not induce biases. This analysis of legal complications in attracting and recruiting talent is never a mere procedure, it is a manifestation of justice, equal opportunity, and the rule of law. This is a lighthouse which startups use to map a recruitment path to meet the need for growth, as well as consciously ethically legally to build a workplace which adheres to merit, diversity and regulatory compliances EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS Clarity and comprehensiveness in employment contracts are the stepping stones to a healthy employer-employee relationship. This document acts as a guide which enlists the terms and conditions associated with working in an organisation. In the complicated web of these agreements, the job responsibilities play an important role, they bring about clarity and mutual understanding.  This part of the document expresses the tasks the employee will be responsible for as well as mentions projects and performance evaluation. Simultaneously, the compensation system becomes a part of the fabric of the relationship, linking up the financial components. Employee remunerations involve base salaries, bonuses, and other benefits which should be well-defined and under employment regulations.  Confidentiality clauses sets down what shall be considered confidential data, the period of confidentiality obligations, and liabilities for breaches. Non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, which may be applicable, add extra layers of protection, on the one hand, creating a delicate balance between the avoidance of the company's interests and the respect for employees' professional mobility, on the other hand. Concluding clauses, with their subtle provisions, regulate the termination of the employment relationship, too, by providing benefits, perks, pensions, health care, notice periods, severance terms and reasons for the termination as well. The provision of a dispute resolution mechanism built into these contracts provides a structured approach to the resolution of conflicts that enhances efficiency and decreases the number of legal issues. At the end of the day, these contracts are more than a legal document, rather, they serve as an indispensable tool in the symbiotic and healthy partnership between startups and their workers. WORKPLACE POLICIES Robust policies are necessary for startups aspiring to build cultures which are positive and compliant, establishing anti-discrimination policies, codes of conduct, and other essential policies all startups should have. Workplace policies in startups serve as a key pillar of the business, forming the culture and moulding compliance. These  guidelines are a compass for employees to deal with professional behaviour and expectations. Showcasing the company's commitment to anti-bias against race, gender, age or any protected categories, startups produce an inclusive environment which stimulates creativity. The code of ethics establishes the norm for ethical behaviour and outlines what is acceptable or not equally important. They are the north star, playing the role of a guide in ensuring the employees make decisions which are in line with the company's values and contribute to the formation of a positive workplace culture. With the increasing use of remote job opportunities and digital communication, it is key for startups to develop sophisticated policies on the use of technology and data protection, making sure delicate information is never misused. These policies, when merged, form a cultural foundation which serves the interests of the startup and also provides a workplace where everyone feels honoured, respected, and of value to the collective success of the venture. WAGE AND HOUR COMPLIANCE Compliance with wage and hour laws is a tricky issue, especially for young companies with limited financial outlays. Overtime, minimum wage and other wage-related legalities: startups need to understand how they will pay their workers by the law. The area of compliance concerning wages and hours in startup management is one of the most challenging aspects, mainly for startups with limited resources. In addition to these foundational parts, wage-related legalities cover meal, and rest periods as well as adding more items to compliance, making the job tough. This intricate level requires a multi-plan strategy where the startups must be in a position to quickly react to the evolving labour laws. This vigilance makes sure there is a continuity between legal frameworks and fair compensation practices that create a regulatory compliant corporate culture which is based on fairness and respect. All in all, having this avenue prevents legal liabilities and also develops a rhythm of the workplace, which is appealing to employees, and later the  foundation for the sustainability of the startup. TERMINATION AND LEGAL RISKS While nobody likes to contemplate it, understanding the legal implications of dismissal is necessary. A manual including proper procedures which minimise the legal risks which come from employee termination has to be part of a startup’s operation. Handling the delicate issue of employee termination is a vital but often an embarrassing point in running a successful startup company. Termination is never about only checking the box, but the essential exercise undertaken to guard the interests of both the organisation and the employees.  During this period, thinking about termination may not be tempting for a startup, but being cognisant of the legal implications is the key to minimising the risks of termination. From making sure there are written termination clauses in employment contracts to paying attention to the notice periods and severance terms, startups need to go through this process with exactness. It is a fine line between the company's interests and being fair to the employees who already left. It endows a startup with the much-needed legal knowledge and also reinforces the significance of creating a culture which encourages clear communication and healthy employee relations through the exit process which can be a nightmare. A startup must be proactive in acknowledging and legally addressing termination complexities to build a foundation of trust and compliance, which then serves as a platform for long-term growth. THE LEGAL ASPECT OF HR MAY BE A CHALLENGE, HOWEVER, IT’S ALSO A CHANCE STARTUP SHOULD NEVER MISS Knowing and taking good care of the legal aspects, startups build a strong foundation for long-term growth and success. It is in the dynamic world of startups, where innovation and development is breathtaking, dealing with the complications of the law in the area of Human Resources is never only a challenge but a strategic gateway.  Along with the growth of startups into full-fledged businesses, there is a need for a sophisticated understanding of legalities in managing the workforce. This is a multi-step process which entails walking through the intricate maze of recruiting, employment contracts, workplace policies, wage and hour compliance, employee benefits, as well as delicate issues of termination. Nevertheless, the flipside of the coin holds the potential to give birth to a solid foundation that serves as a launchpad for continuous development. In a choreography of legal duties and organisational development, startups have the chance both to follow legal rules and to create a workplace environment which is positively received by the staff. This is a journey of turning difficulties into opportunities and building a company culture which survives and also thrives in the dynamic startup environment. Startups move through these regulatory loopholes by exerting due diligence and foresight. They never only manage the challenges; they emerge compliant as well as capable of long-lasting success.

The date marks the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill.   The legislation ensures that all employees have the legal right to request flexible working. This can include requests to change the number of hours they work, when they start or finish work, the days they work, and where they work. Once in force, workers are set to benefit from new protections:  New requirements for employers to consult with the employee before rejecting their flexible working request Permission to make two statutory requests in any 12-month period (rather than the current one request) Reduced waiting times for decisions to be made (within which an employer administers the statutory request) from three months to two months The removal of existing requirements that the employee must explain what effect, if any, the change applied for would have on the employer and how that effect might be dealt with  Following the announcement that the legislation had achieved Royal Assent, Business and Trade Minister Kevin Hollinrake said: “A happier workforce means increased productivity, and that’s why we’re backing measures to give people across the UK even more flexibility over where and when they work. “Not only does flexible working help individuals fit work alongside other commitments – whether it’s the school drop off, studying or caring for vulnerable friends and family – it’s good business sense too, helping firms to attract more talent, increase retention and improve workforce diversity.” How will this work? As of the 6th April, employees will be about to make a statutory application regarding flexible working. Currently, employees must have worked for the same employer for at least 26 weeks to be eligible, but from the 6th April, employees can request flexible working from their first day in a new job. Another change is that previously, employees were only able to make one request in the space of 12 month, but this has now been increased to two requests within the same period. Employers must deal with requests in a reasonable manner. Employers must assess the advantages and disadvantages of the application, hold a meeting to discuss the request with the employee, and offer an appeal process. If an employer doesn’t handle the request in a reasonable manner, the employee can take them to an employee tribunal over it. Though, if the request is handled reasonably, an employer is allowed to refuse an application if they have a good business reason for doing so. Applying for flexible working The basic steps of applying for flexible working are as follows:  The employee writes to the employer with their flexible working request. The application must include the date, a statement that this is a statutory request, details of how the employee wants to work flexibly and when they want to start, an explanation of how they think flexible working might affect the business and how this could be dealt with, and a statement saying if and when they’ve made a previous application. The employer must consider the request and make a decision within two months, or longer if agreed with the employee. If the employer agrees to the request, they must change the terms and conditions in the employee’s contract. If agreeing to the application, the employer should write to the employee with a statement of the agreed changes, and a start date for when this will take effect. All of this should be done as soon as possible, but no later than 28 days after the request was approved. If the employer disagrees, they must write to the employee giving the business reasons for the refusal. Employers may reject an application for different reasons, such as: extra costs that will damage the business, the work cannot be reorganised among other staff, people cannot be recruited to do the work, flexible working will affect quality and performance, the business will not be able to meet customer demand, there’s a lack of work to do during the proposed working times, the business is planning changes to the workforce. The employee may be able to complain to an employment tribunal if they believe the request has not been dealt with in a reasonable manner.  Reactions from the industry The workforce has responded positively to the announcement of this legislation. A study conducted by Slack which surveyed 1,000 UK desk workers found that over half (55%) of employees plan to apply for new flexible working arrangements following the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill. It is estimated that the largest demographic set to benefit from this change is working parents, who are more likely to request earlier working hours to align with school hours. Though some people don’t believe this bill is quite enough to make a real difference. Ronni Zehavi, CEO and Co-Founder of HiBob commented: “The Employee Relations (Flexible Working) Act, Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act and Carer’s Leave legislation represent important steps forward in the UK – however, they still fall short of the needs of modern employees. We all know that the workplace has fundamentally changed post-pandemic with the prevalence of hybrid work models. Businesses offering only the bare minimum to employees with vastly different expectations risk being left behind, as individuals have no qualms about seeking better opportunities elsewhere. They must actively address the unique needs of their workforce to remain competitive. “Take childcare as an example. The new support will enable thousands of parents – specifically women who take on a disproportionate share of unpaid caregiving – to re-enter the workforce. However, if they return to a workplace with a lack of flexibility, balancing personal and professional responsibilities will be a huge challenge, where in some cases, they are forced to make sacrifices. This in turn, causes inequality in the workplace, which has caused over five in 10 (53%) women to state that having children negatively impacted career progress.  “The point is legislation can only go so far. It is down to the employers to create cultures where everyone can thrive. Being able to request flexible work from day one is progress but doesn’t allow for the realistic needs of people. Companies need to put their employees first in order to retain top talent – creating real change and in turn, boosting business profits.” Molly Johnson-Jones, flexible working expert and co-founder and CEO of Flexa, stated: “Crucially, there's no guarantee that these requests for flexible work will be granted. Making employers consult employees about their application, as the secondary legislation (the Employment Relations Act 2023) which is also coming into effect, is unlikely to change this either. This could leave thousands of employees who rely on flexible work in precarious positions if their requests are turned down. Individuals should know whether their needs can be accommodated before they accept a role. “The new legislation risks exacerbating \"fake flexibility”, where companies claim to offer flexible working on job adverts, but are under no obligation to offer it in practice. This makes it nearly impossible for job seekers to determine which employers will genuinely accommodate their requests for flexible work. Job seekers deserve more than legislation that risks further muddying the waters around flexible work entitlements. “What employees really need and deserve is clarity from employers about the level of flexibility they can offer, whether that’s fully remote work, hybrid work or 5 days in an office. This is the only way for job seekers to identify companies that can accommodate their working preferences. It's also the best way for employers to find staff who will genuinely thrive in the working environment they offer.” Though, the introduction of the Flexible Working Bill on the 6th April is a great first step in ensuring a more fair playing field for those who may not be able to work the traditional 9-5 hours due to parenthood and care responsibilities.   \n",

towards overcoming the historical lack of diversity within the tech workforce, as data suggests that more than half (52%) set diversity targets (up from 46% last year).   The Diversity in Tech 2023 report from emerging talent and reskill training provider, Wiley Edge, found that many businesses are seeking to rewrite tech’s historically poor reputation for diversity, with considerable success. Wiley Edge’s research, which included surveying 300 respondents in senior IT leadership roles within medium to large enterprises, highlighted that businesses are increasingly embracing anti-bias hiring strategies. This is proving to impact workforce diversity positively in turn. Setting diversity targets was the most widely used strategy of businesses surveyed. But the report also suggests that anti-bias training for interviewers (used by 43% of businesses) and blind CV reviews (used by 31%) are on the rise - up from 41% and 25% respectively last year. However, the same proportion of businesses publish neutral job descriptions as last year (44%), while only 25% of businesses prioritise diverse shortlists, down from 37% last year.  Those taking proactive steps are reaping the benefits and setting a positive example for other businesses grappling with workforce diversity challenges. Wiley Edge’s research found that a significant 96% of businesses using a strategy have noticed a positive impact on their workforce diversity. Importantly, this is being recognised by employees, with just 6% of Gen Z tech workers surveyed feeling that diversity was not a priority to their employer during their own recruitment journey. Khadijah Pandor, Head of Partnerships, EMEA & NA, at Wiley Edge, commented: “It’s encouraging to see the beginnings of a success story start to emerge, as employers of tech talent take action and introduce strategies to help improve workforce diversity. The positive outcomes that many employers are seeing only reinstates the value of this type of work, setting a positive example for other industries facing challenges to follow suit. “However, there is still more to be done to encourage talent from diverse backgrounds to consider and feel equipped to pursue a career in tech. Through our work with clients in high-demand sectors from banking to insurance, we’ve seen a real commitment to helping rewrite the code of diversity in tech. But, understandably, it can be difficult for busy employers to know where to start.  “This is why we actively support forward-thinking employers to diversify talent pipelines and help graduates from diverse backgrounds get ready to thrive in the world of work. This includes training graduates from many different universities and supporting a diverse Alumni population of talent - 42% of which are women, and 51% are Black, Asian, or minority ethnic.” A range of different anti-bias hiring strategies were deployed by the businesses surveyed. These included:  Setting diversity targets – identifying areas for improvement, such as increasing the number of women in leadership positions or the proportion of employees from low socio-economic backgrounds Publishing neutral job descriptions – using gender-neutral language and avoiding stereotypically gendered terms in the advertisement of all positions  Conducting blind CV reviews – removing any indicators of the candidate’s identity, such as gender, age, and ethnicity, to focus entirely on their skills and experience Providing anti-bias training for interviewers – supporting those involved in recruitment to recognise any biases and concentrate solely on factors which affect the candidate’s ability to deliver in post Prioritising diverse shortlists – ensuring that candidates selected for the final stages are from a diverse range of backgrounds   \n",

                                                                                                       Take the time to do some research, and you can quickly find the names of 50 leading UK-based black tech entrepreneurs, all highly respected and the powerhouses behind successful businesses.   No doubt, they all make significant contributions to the £25 billion generated into the UK economy every year by small entrepreneur business owners from ethnic minority backgrounds. However, those figures could be even more impressive if the Black community could increase its presence in the tech sector. Sadly, it is a fact of life that those from ethnic minority backgrounds face challenges that other entrepreneurs do not encounter, such as disproportionately greater difficulty in accessing finance and a lack of mainstream support. That is why Ashleigh Ainsley, one of the Top 50 black tech entrepreneurs and co-founder of London-based Colorintech, has become a driving force in the movement to increase the number of ethnic minorities entering the UK tech workforce. His overriding passion has driven a professional mission for him to make London the most inclusive tech hub in the world. \"By building programs that create access to some of the world's most innovative companies for ethnic minorities, we believe we can create a more inclusive tech industry that will ultimately result in wealth creation and close opportunity gaps. It is vital that we continue to work with corporate partners to co-develop leadership and development programs for their workforce to drive inclusion as part of that process,\" said Ainsley. He added, \"Increasing Black representation in the tech sector will have benefits beyond wages. It will improve the lives of those who are marginalized and undervalued in the workplace. But beyond that, we are at the precipice of the next industrial revolution, and it would be a huge oversight if we systematically ignored the contributions diverse professionals have to make in shaping that future.\" Alarmingly, while the data is scarce, Black people are estimated to make up just three percent of the UK tech workforce, despite the majority of tech roles being in London, where they make up 14% of the population. Data suggests that the problem is not the qualification or merit of applicants but rather a lack of opportunity, a dearth of contacts, and often an unwillingness from those in positions of power to deliver meaningful initiatives to improve workforce diversity. \"Underlying issues, such as discrimination, are deep-rooted and will take time and effort to change. But there are many who believe that the time for excuses justifying the lack of Black representation in the UK tech ecosystem is over,\" said Mr. Ainsley. \"Our own Barriers research suggests that 60 percent of Black professionals have experienced significant obstacles and barriers to entering the sector.\" Ainsley added, \"In today's multicultural society, there is simply no reason why ethnic minorities should still face discrimination and microaggressions in the workplace.\" Since Colorintech's inception five years ago, it has helped a community of 30,000 and seen 5,000 tech professionals through its programs. Black tech talent does exist, but if the UK is going to truly thrive in an increasingly competitive global economy, it cannot ignore the inequity exacerbating skill shortages in the sector that result from excluding black professionals. \"It is more than just a question of race and diversity. If companies are to grow and prosper, then Black representation in the tech sector must be given the opportunity to thrive and develop,\" said Mr. Ainsley. \"Our mission is to empower and inspire, to show the world that Black excellence in entrepreneurship and professional careers is not just a pipe dream or confined to a few 'success stories.' Given the opportunity, Black Tech Talent will become an even more significant contributor to the UK tech landscape.”   \n",

Why should startups invest early in diverse people, and how they can do this to make a greater social impact whilst also improving business?    Recent Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements helped shed light on the challenges women and ethnic minorities continue to face seeking equity in society today. These powerful social and political movements undoubtedly had an impact on peoples’ thinking – and impacted how businesses lead and support their own micro-communities too. We are seeing a promising move towards allyship and more inclusive hiring practices in business, diverse teams and boards, and more career support for those from under-represented groups. While there is still more work to be done, the benefits of early-stage businesses championing a more diverse and inclusive working environment are undeniable. Talent poor, to talent powered Brexit, global supply chain problems and COVID-19 proved the perfect storm for British businesses, further exacerbating the skills problems across almost every industry. According to research by Skillsoft, around three-quarters of IT decision-makers worldwide claim to be facing critical skills gaps across tech departments. Talent is in short supply and organisations are having to fight for limited resources.  When it comes to startup hiring, every action and every decision is critical – in a small team one employee has the potential to drive significant growth in the company. While startups may be attractive to jobseekers because of their high-growth potential, earning opportunities and agile nature – these are not always the most important aspects employees are looking for. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&) is now a significant factor for job seekers in the market today. According to a Glassdoor survey, 72% of women, 89% of black respondents, 80% of Asians, and 70% of Latinos, said workforce diversity was important to them. This was a sentiment echoed by a significant majority of white respondents, who also said workforce diversity was important when selecting their next role.  Diverse and inclusive businesses are opening themselves up to a much larger talent pool than the companies who continue to recruit in the same way they have for 30 years. Startups have a genuine opportunity to not only entice great diverse teams by committing to an inclusive talent attraction strategy in the early-stages of their businesses, but to grow and nurture a truly inclusive working culture too. Employees from every group need to feel psychologically safe to bring their unique perspectives forward and the lessons learned here, will enable startups to scale sustainably and ethically.  Engines of innovation At its core, a startup is a problem-solving entity seeking answers to multiple questions. Its ideas come from people, and teams of people working together. If a startup were to nring together a group of innovators that share the same life experiences and dimensions to build a new product or solution – they are eradicating diversity of thought and unlikely to produce something that is unique, relevant and accessible to all factions of society today. The more diverse teams are across gender, ethnicity, age, educational background, experience level and expertise - the more likely your creative team will draw inspiration from seemingly unrelated places.   When it comes to deciding which ideas to test and put more resources behind, diverse teams are also far better than homogenous ones. With more pathways to execute on an idea, you will see diverse teams move forward with - or ditch - ideas far faster and more cost-effectively.  On average, startups take three to four years to be profitable, but 2019 analysis from Mckinsey & Company found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25 percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. In the case of ethnic and cultural diversity, the business-case findings were equally compelling: top-quartile companies outperformed those in the fourth by 36 percent in profitability.  How to make ED&I a priority How do startups and larger, more advanced organisations integrate ED&I into their business strategies to reap the rewards of more diverse teams? The first step is to make your founders and business leaders aware of the benefits of being an inclusive business and to acknowledge the need for change.   Audit: Look at your existing talent attraction and retention practices, and assess current strengths and opportunities to gauge what is working, and what isn’t. Have you created an inclusive culture? Does your leadership reflect that? Plan: If your organisation does not have the infrastructure in place to make immediate improvements to your diversity strategy, allocate resources to develop permanent training programs and policies. The makeup of your senior leadership team, top management, your customers, and key stakeholders are all huge signifiers to the rest of your workforce. Sustain: Make accountability a priority. For example, make all hiring managers must all share in the vital objective to provide equal opportunities access to roles, if this is the wider business goal.  Go public: Just as annual business objectives may be shared within an organisation to encourage all teams to work towards the same goal – diversity and inclusion goals should also be made public. If you meet these benchmarks, share the successes with your employees and be transparent about any setbacks - just keep moving forward.  The survival of a startup relies on its profitability, growth, agility and innovation – all areas where people are critical in contributing to success. The renewed focus on employers to prioritise diversity and ensure people of different genders, ethnicities and backgrounds are given equal opportunity to contribute, is important for every social impact business. However, diversity and inclusion is also integral to business success. Understanding this relationship is what will help businesses – of every shape and size – to truly build a corporate culture that supports and values different perspectives.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      New research from the University of Surrey finds BAME and LGBTQI+ youths at most risk of harm online. Minority Groups At Risk Of Online Harm Young people from minority groups – such as those from Black, Asian, minority ethnic backgrounds, and LGBTQI+ youth – are more likely to be exposed to and experience online harms than their white, heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, according to new research from the University of Surrey. While the research found that most young people do not regularly or directly experience online harm, a ‘substantial’ percentage of young people are exposed to harmful materials or content when logged on. Dr Emily Setty, co-author of the study and Lecturer in Criminology at the University of Surrey, said: “Our research makes clear that we must work with young people – particularly those from minority backgrounds – to identify and develop solutions that effectively prevent online harms. “A one-size-fits-all approach to minimising harm can’t hope to tackle the discrimination that seems to be hard-wired into young people’s online experiences. While young people were familiar with technical solutions to combat these risks, such as blocking and reporting accounts, our research highlighted that digital safety education is needed to help them develop critical understanding around these issues.” Sexist, Racist, Homophobic & Transphobic Content According to the research, a substantial number of young people have encountered or experienced online harms and exposure to sexist, racist, homophobic and transphobic content. Furthermore, the research highlighted that young women are at a heightened risk of being targeted with unwanted sexual content and often experience negative impacts – such as dissatisfaction with their bodies – associated with this behaviour. As part of a series of focus groups, participants aged 12 to 16 were shown a display of words relating to risks and harms online and were asked for their reactions. They discussed how different issues they experienced played out online, the actions they took to deal with them, and their views on digital safety education. Additionally, they discussed the benefits of being online and how they balanced risks and opportunities. Amidst the ongoing debate about the age restriction of social media channels and how Big Tech companies make them safer, the research team at Surrey also found that young people who use social media apps at a higher rate are more at risk than young people who spend their time on activities such as gaming or streaming. Emma Robertson, Co-Founder of online safety organisation Digital Awareness UK, said: “This research resonates with the conversations our organisation is having with young people about topics such as online hate speech, which they are experiencing at alarming rates. Much awareness and progress has come about as a result of big social movements which have played out online, such as racism in football or sexual harassment, as seen with Everyone’s Invited. “However, at a time when discussions about topics such as race, identity and sexuality are being debated and spotlighted online, we must remember that young people are also experiencing unprecedented amounts of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia online. This only highlights the pressing need for educators, parents and carers to get the support they require to help young people manage these challenges, and for policymakers and tech companies to help make online spaces as inclusive and safe as possible.”   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  AI (artificial intelligence) is an amazing tool to improve efficiency and speed up processes but when not used properly can cause more damage than good. With this in mind, how can companies ensure that they’re using AI ethically and responsibly? Christophe Bourguignat, CEO & co-founder of Insurance tech provider Zelros, lists his top 4 things that companies need to know to ensure that they’re using AI ethically and responsibly in 2022. Tip #1: Biases in AI are not always where you think they are When most people look for biases in AI, it’s usually focused on unbalanced training data. For example, if there are more men than women who are represented in the dataset, or vice versa. This isn’t the only place where an AI bias can happen though: it can also be when an AI algorithm is used outside of the content it was initially created for. For example, a product that is specifically built for farmers wouldn’t have factory workers or business executives represented. This isn’t AI bias, but design bias. Tip #2: Have a diverse team Left unchecked, human biases can find their way into datasets, corrupting the decision making process that the system uses to generate solutions. Having a team that is diverse brings diverse thoughts and opinions, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, ages, etc. will not only challenge ideas, but can catch biases before they’re implemented into your AI system. Having a diverse team truly makes the difference when striving for a stronger Ethical AI framework, especially when ensuring the avoidance of Simpson Paradoxes. Tip #3: Use bias bounties One way to detect biases and discrimination in AI is to use bias bounties to catch bad data, avoiding further deviation of the analytics. Bias bounties are implemented to reward users for identifying bias in AI systems. These biases happen as a result of incomplete data or existing bad data that can lead to an AI that is unethical. Several major companies are using bias bounties in 2022 as a way to ensure their AI systems are as ethical and robust as possible. It’s an easy and relatively inexpensive way to get more diverse thought processes to look at and review your AI. Tip #4: Cultivate responsible AI at every level of your company Having responsible AI at all levels within an organisation is a necessity, especially now in 2022. Before, organisations could get by with just having it in their technical R&D or research teams involved, who would then communicate downward to their customers and partners. With the ever changing landscape of responsible AI use, this is an area where no compromises can be made.   \n",

Underrepresented Talent (19 out of 20*) During times of social and economic uncertainty, it is often those from lower socio-economic backgrounds that are the worst affected. During the pandemic, these groups are less likely to have had access to support networks and technology, making working virtually incredibly difficult. This is hindering career progression, building on pre-existing workplace injustices. For example, in the Financial Services sector, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds take on average 25% longer to develop in their careers. This figure increases to 32% amongst people from lower socio-economic backgrounds who identify as black. Hospitality Industry (18 out of 20) Throughout much of 2020 and 2021, the industry was forced to place thousands of people on furlough due to COVID-19 restrictions effectively bringing the whole sector to a halt. Even now that businesses have been able to reopen, many of these workers have decided not to return, finding new industries to work in. This has created a new challenge, leaving hospitality bosses with a significant employee shortage.

What Will This Mean For Posts? University Students (17 out of 20) With many businesses pausing recruitment during the height of the pandemic, and so many internships and placements being cut, opportunities for graduates simply weren’t there. In addition, ‘on campus’ events moved online. This has been better than nothing, but the virtual environment often fails to give students the same results and networking opportunities as in-person interactions, putting them at a disadvantage compared to previous cohorts when attempting to enter the workplace. School students (14 out of 20) Young people have missed out on vital classroom experiences during the pandemic. Interacting with and learning from peers, face to face teaching and developing softer skills are all crucial to future success. For many, home learning was not possible due to lack of tech, space, or broadband capabilities. There were also fewer opportunities for work experience, which can be critical in introducing young people to career options available to them and equipping them with the knowledge and confidence they need to pursue a specific path. According to the ISE’s Recruitment Survey, released in November 2021, the number of internships and placement years offered did rise between 2019/20 and 2020/21, by 77% and 63% respectively, but are still nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. New Starters (8 out of 20) Onboarding during the pandemic and numerous lockdowns has been tough, stopping people building important in-person relationships with colleagues. As with any new role, ‘learning by osmosis’ is crucial to progression, belonging and long-term successes. This isn’t happening for millions of new starters who are joining the workforce from home. This will likely have a detrimental effect on the speed at which they can progress. Will Akerman, Founder and MD of Connectr, concludes: “At Connectr, we specialise in understanding and nurturing underrepresented talent, and this gives us a unique insight into how the pandemic has impacted certain groups. The past two years have been tough for all of us, but for these five groups it has been even harder than anyone could have imagined. A lack of jobs, opportunities and support has left people feeling a sense of uncertainty, with many unsure where to turn to revive or kick start their careers. This simply isn’t fair and Connectr will continue to work with both the Government and UK businesses to support the most disadvantaged groups, ensuring nobody is left behind in the nation’s post-pandemic recovery.” *METHODOLOGY To determine the list of the top five biggest losers of lockdown, the experts at Connectr looked at all key groups effected by the pandemic and assigned them a score out of 10 for both the financial and the emotional impact caused by COVID-19. The financial impact score was based on factors including salary lost, employment opportunities missed, and time wasted. The emotional impact included measures such as increased stress, discrimination, and additional time pressures. This gave each group a score out of 20, 20 being the most impacted and 0 being the least impacted.

                            The UK data watchdog has warned that neurotech has a “real danger” of bias and discrimination if proper precautions are not made. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said today that developments in neurotech – technology that interfaces with the brain or nervous system – could lead to discrimination against people if they are not “put at the heart of their development”. The regulator said that technology that monitors neurodata will become widespread in the next decade. One such company is Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing brain implants that it hopes to one day commercialise. Neurotech is currently most commonly used in the healthcare sector to predict, diagnose and treat complex conditions. The ICO, however, has said the tech will likely expand beyond the tightly regulated medical industry and be deployed across personal wellbeing, sports, marketing and other consumer industries. The regulator said that without proper testing on a wide range of subjects, and various groups – notably neurodivergent people – there will be a risk of discrimination. “To many, the idea of neurotechnology conjures up images of science fiction films, but this technology is real, and it is developing rapidly,” said Stephen Almond, executive director of regulatory risk. “Neurotechnology collects intimate personal information that people are often not aware of, including emotions and complex behaviour. The consequences could be dire if these technologies are developed or deployed inappropriately. “We want to see everyone in society benefit from this technology. It’s important for organisations to act now to avoid the real danger of discrimination.” The watchdog warned that future uses of neurotech will lead to unfair treatment without diverse data training. The ICO is currently developing neurodata guidance that will consider the “interpretation of core legislative and technical neurotechnology definitions”.    \n",

                      A former Uber Eats courier has brought legal action against the food delivery company, alleging he was unfairly dismissed because of the company’s “racist” facial recognition software. Uber Eats drivers are required to take a selfie before starting a shift to verify their identity. However, Pa Edrissa Manjang said that the Uber Eats app told him to take multiple selfies a day because the software incorrectly thought he was someone else. “Your algorithm, by the looks of things, is racist,” said Manjang, who is Black. On Wednesday an employment tribunal rejected Uber’s motion to dismiss the discrimination claim, which means the case will move to a full hearing. An Uber spokesperson told UKTN that “automated facial verification was not the reason for Mr Manjang’s temporary loss of access to his courier account”. The spokesperson added that Uber Eats’ Real-Time ID Check is used for safety and security purposes. “The system includes robust human review to make sure that we’re not making decisions about someone’s livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight,” the spokesperson said. Manjang told the Guardian that Uber doesn’t “value” or “respect” its delivery drivers and that it acts in an “aggressive manner”. “So, as a result, for the people that work for them, we are just numbers,” said Manjang. AI bias It’s not the first time that Uber has faced accusations that its facial recognition software is racially biased. In October last year, Abiodun Ogunyemi filed an employment tribunal case after Uber’s automated face-scanning software failed to recognise him, leading to his dismissal. AI experts say that facial recognition systems generally are not as accurate at identifying people from ethnic minority backgrounds. They say that this is often because the data used to train the algorithm tends to skew towards white men, which makes the software more accurate at identifying people from that demographic compared to others. Uber is not the only company facing legal issues over the use of facial recognition technology. Yesterday, Big Brother Watch filed a complaint against Southern Co-op over the use of the tech in 35 of its stores. Clearview AI was fined £7.5m by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) earlier this year for illegally collecting billions of images. The ICO is currently investigating if AI has a racial bias. It comes at a time when the use of digital identification applications are gradually increasing across the country. Some cinemas have begun accepting digital IDs as a method of proving age.    \n",
